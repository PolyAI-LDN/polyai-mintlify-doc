## Rules

Use Global **Rules** in your Agent Settings to define how your assistant behaves across all its interactions. This includes its language, task execution, management of difficult scenarios, and compliance with your business requirements. Configuring rules effectively ensures a durable and consistent customer experience.

### What are rules?

Rules guide the behavior of your assistant by providing specific instructions on how it should respond to users, perform tasks, and manage sensitive scenarios. This section is crucial for:

- Defining the assistant's tone, language, and mannerisms.
- Ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
- Managing edge cases or high-risk interactions.

### Types of rules

#### 1. Behavior and interaction guidelines

Set rules for how the assistant interacts with users, including:

- **Tone**: Specify whether the tone should be formal, casual, empathetic, etc.
  Example: "Always remain polite and professional, even when users are frustrated."

- **Language style**: Define language-specific preferences (e.g., avoiding jargon, using simple terms).
  Example: "Use simple, clear language suitable for non-technical users."

- **Consistency**: Ensure the assistant adheres to company branding and messaging.

#### 2. Task execution

Define how the assistant should perform specific tasks:

- **Clear instructions**: Be explicit about the actions required.
  Example: "If a user asks about refunds, provide the refund policy link and offer to send it via SMS."

- **Response limitations**: Restrict the assistant to specific knowledge areas or tasks.
  Example: "Only provide information about your account's services; do not answer general queries outside this domain."

#### 3. Content restrictions

Establish boundaries for what the assistant can and cannot say:

- **Sensitive topics**: Prohibit responses on certain subjects.
  Example: "Do not discuss politics, religion, or personal opinions."

- **Accuracy**: Instruct the assistant to avoid guessing or fabricating responses.
  Example: "If unsure, direct the user to a human agent or a verified source."

### Best practices

1. **Be specific and actionable**
   Use precise language to avoid ambiguity.
   Example: Instead of "Be helpful," use "Answer all questions about billing within two sentences and provide follow-up actions if needed."

2. **Provide examples**
   Include examples of expected user interactions and appropriate responses to guide the assistant's behavior.
   Example:
   - User: "What is your refund policy?"
   - Assistant: "You can find our refund policy here: [link]. Would you like me to text this link to your phone?"

3. **Plan for edge cases**
   Address high-risk scenarios (e.g., emergency calls, user frustration).
   Example: "For emergency-related queries, immediately request the user terminate the call and contact 911."

4. **Test and iterate**
   Regularly review the assistant's performance and refine rules based on real-world interactions.

### Example rules for common scenarios

- **Handoff to human agent**
  "If the user explicitly asks for a human agent or uses language suggesting dissatisfaction, trigger a call handoff."

- **Sensitive query handling**
  "For any query outside the assistant's domain, respond: 'I'm sorry, I can't assist with that. Please contact our support team for further help.'"

- **Consistency in responses**
  "Always begin responses with 'Thank you for reaching out!' to maintain a friendly tone."

Make sure you regularly monitor and update rules to ensure they align with your business goals and user expectations.

## Pronunciations

PolyAI utilizes advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models to convert assistant text responses into spoken language. While these models are highly effective, they may occasionally mispronounce domain-specific terms, uncommon words, or proper nouns. To address this, Jupiter introduces the TTS Pronunciations feature, enabling you to define and manage pronunciation rules directly within the platform. This integration streamlines the workflow, allowing for precise control over how the Assistant articulates specific phrases and terms.

### Key points

- **Enhanced Pronunciation Accuracy**: Correctly pronounce domain-specific terms and unique phrases using IPA.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Manage TTS rules directly within Jupiter without the need for external configuration files.
- **Flexibility**: Insert natural pauses and adjust pronunciations to suit various use cases and industries.

### Key benefits

- **Improved Voice Quality**: Ensure that critical terms are pronounced accurately, enhancing the naturalness and professionalism of the Assistant’s voice.
- **Domain-Specific Customization**: Tailor pronunciations to fit the unique terminology of your industry, such as medical, legal, or hospitality sectors.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Eliminate the need for external configuration by managing TTS rules within Jupiter, saving time and reducing complexity.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide users with clear and accurate voice interactions, minimizing misunderstandings and improving satisfaction.

### How it works

The TTS Pronunciations feature allows builders to define specific pronunciation rules using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). By creating TTS rules objects that include regular expressions and IPA replacements, you can control how the Assistant pronounces certain words or phrases. This ensures that domain-specific terminology is accurately transcribed and spoken, improving the Assistant’s overall performance and reliability.

### Getting started

#### Configuring TTS Pronunciations

1. **Access the Rules Page**: Navigate to the Pronunciations section in Jupiter.
2. **Manage TTS Rules Objects**:
   - Create, edit, or delete TTS rules objects.
3. **Define Pronunciation Rules**:
   - **Expression**: Enter a regular expression to identify the target word or phrase.
   - **Replacement**: Provide the IPA symbols that represent the correct pronunciation.
   - **Case Sensitive**: Toggle the boolean option to determine if the rule is case sensitive.

### Feature details

#### TTS Rules Objects

TTS Rules Objects are the core components of the TTS Pronunciations feature. Each object consists of:

- **Regex (Regular Expression)**: Identifies the specific word or phrase to target within the text.
- **Replacement**: Uses IPA symbols to define the correct pronunciation of the identified word or phrase.
- **Case Sensitive**: Determines whether the rule should be applied in a case-sensitive manner.

#### Example

- **Regex**: `/\bAudi\b/`
- **Replacement**: `/ˈaʊdi/`
- **Case Sensitive**: `TRUE`

This rule ensures that the word "Audi" is pronounced as "ˈaʊdi" whenever it appears in the text, maintaining consistency and accuracy.

#### IPA Integration

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) provides a standardized system for phonetic notation, allowing precise control over pronunciation. By integrating IPA into the TTS Pronunciations feature, your assistant can articulate domain-specific terms accurately and naturally.
