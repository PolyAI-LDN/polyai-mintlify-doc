Define your agent's behavior with **Global Rules** in the Agent Settings. Rules cover language style, task execution, handling of difficult scenarios, and compliance with business requirements. Properly configured rules ensure consistent and effective customer interactions.

### What are rules?

Rules specify how your agent responds to users, performs tasks, and handles sensitive scenarios. Use rules to:

- Set the agent's tone, language, and behavior.
- Ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- Address edge cases and high-risk interactions.

You can edit behavior rules by going to the **Agent** tab and scrolling to the **Behavior** section.

**Example:**

For a museum agent that always refers to "exhibits" instead of "artworks":

<Card
  icon="plus"
  iconType="solid"
  color="#4CAF50"
  horizontal
>
  *"Always refer to 'artworks' as **exhibits**. Do not use the term 'artworks' in any context."*
</Card>

### Types of rules

#### 1. Behavior and interaction guidelines

Specify how the agent interacts with users:

- **Tone**: Choose formal, casual, empathetic, or calm tones.
  - **Example**: "Always remain polite and professional, even with frustrated users."

- **Language style**: Simplify language or avoid jargon as needed.
  - **Example**: "Use clear, simple language suitable for non-technical users."

- **Consistency**: Align responses with branding and messaging.
  - **Example**: "Always address visitors as 'guests' rather than 'customers.'"

#### 2. Task execution

<Tip> Be clear, direct, and concise when defining tasks. </Tip>

- **Explicit instructions**: Clearly define actions.
  - **Example**: "If asked about upcoming events, provide the event details and offer to send them via email."

- **Response scope**: Limit responses to specific tasks or topics.
  - **Example**: "Only answer questions related to museum exhibits. Avoid general queries outside this domain."

#### 3. Content restrictions

Set boundaries for what the agent can or cannot say:

- **Sensitive topics**: Avoid prohibited subjects. For details, see the [Safety Dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/safety).
  - **Example**: "Do not discuss politics, religion, or personal opinions."

- **Accuracy**: Avoid fabricated or uncertain answers.
  - **Example**: "If unsure, direct the user to a staff member or a verified source."

### Best practices

1. **Be specific**: Avoid ambiguity.
   - **Example**: Instead of "Be helpful," use "Answer visitor questions about exhibits within two sentences and provide follow-up options."

2. **Provide examples**: Demonstrate expected interactions and responses.
   - **Example**:
     - Visitor: "What time does the museum close?"
     - Agent: "The museum closes at 6 PM. Would you like a list of activities available before closing?"

3. **Plan for edge cases**: Handle emergency or high-risk scenarios.
   - **Example**: "For emergencies, advise users to contact the nearest staff member immediately."

4. **Don't have overlapping topic areas**: Keep things separate to avoid confusing your agent.
   - **Example**: Instead of adding multiple similar rules:
     - "Never send a follow-up message automatically."
     - "If a follow-up message is available, always offer it."
     - "Never send a follow-up message without user consent."

     Use a single rule:
     - "Only send follow-ups if the user agrees."

5. **Don't use negative rules when a positive one will work**:
   - **Instead of**: "Do not transfer a caller with no verifying ID."
   - **Use**: "Always verify ID before transferring."

6. **Test and iterate**: Regularly review and refine rules.

### Example rules

- **Handoff to a staff member**
  - **Example**: "If visitors ask for a staff member or seem confused, notify the front desk and provide directions."

- **Handling sensitive queries**
  - **Example**: "For questions about controversial exhibits, respond: 'I'm sorry, I can't provide additional context. Please contact our curator for more information.'"

- **Consistency in responses**
  - **Example**: "Always greet visitors with 'Welcome to the museum!' before answering their question."
