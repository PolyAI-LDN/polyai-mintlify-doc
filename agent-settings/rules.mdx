description: 'Set global rules and customize text-to-speech pronunciations for your agent.'
---

Define your agent's behavior with **Global Rules** in the Agent Settings. Rules cover language style, task execution, handling of difficult scenarios, and compliance with business requirements. Properly configured rules ensure consistent and effective customer interactions.

### What are rules?

Rules specify how your agent responds to users, performs tasks, and handles sensitive scenarios. Use rules to:

- Set the agent's tone, language, and behavior.
- Ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- Address edge cases and high-risk interactions.

**Example:**

For a museum agent that always refers to "exhibits" instead of "artworks":

<Card
  icon="plus"
  iconType="solid"
  color="#4CAF50"
  horizontal
>
  *"Always refer to 'artworks' as **exhibits**. Do not use the term 'artworks' in any context."*
</Card>

### Types of rules

![rules-examples](/images/rules-types.png)

#### 1. Behavior and interaction guidelines

Specify how the agent interacts with users:

- **Tone**: Choose formal, casual, empathetic, or calm tones.
  - **Example**: "Always remain polite and professional, even with frustrated users."

- **Language style**: Simplify language or avoid jargon as needed.
  - **Example**: "Use clear, simple language suitable for non-technical users."

- **Consistency**: Align responses with branding and messaging.
  - **Example**: "Always address visitors as 'guests' rather than 'customers.'"

#### 2. Task execution

<Tip> Be clear, direct, and concise when defining tasks. </Tip>

- **Explicit instructions**: Clearly define actions.
  - **Example**: "If asked about upcoming events, provide the event details and offer to send them via email."

- **Response scope**: Limit responses to specific tasks or topics.
  - **Example**: "Only answer questions related to museum exhibits. Avoid general queries outside this domain."

#### 3. Content restrictions

Set boundaries for what the agent can or cannot say:

- **Sensitive topics**: Avoid prohibited subjects. For details, see the [Safety Dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/safety).
  - **Example**: "Do not discuss politics, religion, or personal opinions."

- **Accuracy**: Avoid fabricated or uncertain answers.
  - **Example**: "If unsure, direct the user to a staff member or a verified source."

### Best practices

1. **Be specific**: Avoid ambiguity.
   - **Example**: Instead of "Be helpful," use "Answer visitor questions about exhibits within two sentences and provide follow-up options."

2. **Provide examples**: Demonstrate expected interactions and responses.
   - **Example**:
     - Visitor: "What time does the museum close?"
     - Agent: "The museum closes at 6 PM. Would you like a list of activities available before closing?"

3. **Plan for edge cases**: Handle emergency or high-risk scenarios.
   - **Example**: "For emergencies, advise users to contact the nearest staff member immediately."

4. **Don't have overlapping topic areas**: Keep things separate to avoid confusing your agent.
   - **Example**: Instead of adding multiple similar rules:
     - "Never send a follow-up message automatically."
     - "If a follow-up message is available, always offer it."
     - "Never send a follow-up message without user consent."

     Use a single rule:
     - "Only send follow-ups if the user agrees."

5. **Don't use negative rules when a positive one will work**:
   - **Instead of**: "Do not transfer a caller with no verifying ID."
   - **Use**: "Always verify ID before transferring."

6. **Test and iterate**: Regularly review and refine rules.

### Example rules

- **Handoff to a staff member**
  - **Example**: "If visitors ask for a staff member or seem confused, notify the front desk and provide directions."

- **Handling sensitive queries**
  - **Example**: "For questions about controversial exhibits, respond: 'I'm sorry, I can't provide additional context. Please contact our curator for more information.'"

- **Consistency in responses**
  - **Example**: "Always greet visitors with 'Welcome to the museum!' before answering their question."

## Pronunciations

PolyAI uses [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/glossary/text-to-speech/) to convert text into spoken language. Occasionally, uncommon words, domain-specific terms, or proper nouns may be mispronounced. In these cases, the TTS **Pronunciations** tab is available to embed pronunciation guidelines for key phrases in the global rules.

### Key points

- **Enhanced pronunciation accuracy**: Correctly pronounce domain-specific terms and unique phrases using IPA.
- **Streamlined workflow**: Manage rules directly in the agent studio.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust pauses and pronunciation for various needs.

### Key benefits

- **Improved voice quality**: Ensure accurate and natural speech.
- **Domain-specific customization**: Adapt to the terminology of your industry, whether medical, legal, hospitality, or another area.
- **Efficient workflow**: Eliminate external configuration.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Reduce misunderstandings with clear and accurate responses.

### How it works

Pronunciations use the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://pronunciationstudio.com/english-ipa-chart/) to define pronunciation rules. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) such as `<break>`, `<prosody>`, and `<emphasis>` in the replacement string.

You may define pronunciation rules using regular expressions and replacements, including support for **regex capture groups**.

### Using capture groups in replacements

If your regular expression uses capture groups (for example, `(\d{3})`), you can refer to these in the replacement string using `\1`, `\2`, etc. This allows you to reformat matched text dynamically.

### Example: Formatting a phone number with pauses

To transform a number like `(651) 359-2923` into:

> "six five one [pause] three five nine [pause] two nine two three"

Use the following pronunciation rule:

- **Regex**: `$begin:math:text$?(\\d{3})$end:math:text$?[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(\d{4})`
- **Replacement**: `\1 <break time="0.5s" /> \2 <break time="0.5s" /> \3`
- **Case sensitive**: `FALSE`

This uses [SSML breaks](hhttps://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#break) between capture groups, allowing for natural read-back of phone numbers or similar patterns.

### Example: IPA correction

- **Regex**: `/\bLouvre\b/`
- **Replacement**: `/ˈluːvrə/`
- **Case sensitive**: `FALSE`

This ensures "Louvre" is pronounced correctly.
