The **About** section allows you to configure your agent's key characteristics to personalize its interactions. Here’s
a detailed breakdown of each setting:

## Greeting

The **Greeting** is the agent's opening line. It sets the tone for the interaction and introduces your brand.
Customize it to reflect your brand’s voice and create a welcoming experience for users. You can also include [function calls](/function/introduction) and
[variant calls](/variant-management/introduction) if needed.

## Personality

**Personality** determines the tone and style of communication, such as friendly, professional, empathetic, or casual. Select the option that aligns
 with your business and target audience, or define a custom personality to tailor the agent's demeanor to your brand.

## Roles

The **Role** specifies the agent's function, like customer service representative, sales agent, or technical support specialist. This ensures the
agent delivers relevant, role-specific responses. You can further define role behavior through the [Rules](./rules) section.
