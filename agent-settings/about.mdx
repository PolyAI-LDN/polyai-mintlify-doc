The **About** section in the Agent Settings allows you to configure various aspects of your assistant to personalize its interactions with users. Here's a detailed breakdown of each setting:

## Greet line

The **Greet Line** is the first line the assistant speaks when picking up the call. It serves as an introduction and sets the tone for the interaction. You can customize the greet line to align with your brand's voice and provide a welcoming experience for callers.

## Personality

The **Personality** setting defines the tone and vibe of the assistant's interactions with users. It influences the language, demeanor, and overall character of the assistant. You can choose from a range of personalities, such as friendly, professional, empathetic, or casual, depending on the nature of your business and the preferences of your target audience.

## Roles

The **Roles** setting allows you to define the role that the assistant plays during interactions with users. This can vary based on your specific use case and the goals of the conversation. For example, the assistant could act as a customer service representative, a sales agent, a technical support specialist, or any other role relevant to your business needs. By defining clear roles, you can ensure that the assistant provides relevant and helpful responses to users' inquiries.

By configuring these settings in the About section, you can personalize your assistant's interactions and create a seamless and engaging experience for your customers.

Feel free to customize these settings to best suit your business objectives and user preferences.
