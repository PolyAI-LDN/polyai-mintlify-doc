The **Model** section in the Agent Settings allows you to choose the Language Model (LLM) that best suits your needs. Currently, we support multiple models: **GPT 4.0**, **GPT 3.5**, **GPT 3.5 (0125)**, **GPT 4o**, and **GPT 4o Mini**. Below is a detailed comparison of each model to help you make the best choice for your use case.

## GPT 4.0

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Generates better answers and follows instructions more accurately. | Higher latency, resulting in longer response times. |
| Provides high-quality, detailed responses tailored to user queries. | More expensive compared to other models. |

## GPT 3.5

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Cost-effective with faster response times.  | More prone to hallucinations and may not follow instructions as precisely. |
| Suitable for applications prioritizing speed and cost. | May struggle with complex, multi-step instructions. |

GPT 3.5 is a budget-friendly choice for use cases where real-time responses are important, and minor deviations from accuracy are acceptable, such as chatbot interactions or simpler query handling.


## GPT 3.5 (0125)

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Similar to GPT 3.5 with minor optimizations for specific tasks. | Limited differentiation from standard GPT 3.5 for general use. |
| Best for applications requiring slightly enhanced stability in response generation. | |

This variant of GPT 3.5 is an intermediate option, bridging the gap between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4.0 for those needing marginal improvements without fully transitioning to GPT 4.0.

## GPT 4o

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced version of GPT 4.0 with optimized latency. | Currently in beta; availability might be limited. |
| Delivers high-quality responses with reduced wait times. | Pricing not yet finalized. |

GPT 4o is designed for scenarios requiring the quality of GPT 4.0 but with a more responsive experience. Ideal for customer interactions requiring both precision and efficiency.

## GPT 4o Mini

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Lightweight, faster version of GPT 4o.      | Limited support for complex queries. |
| Best for cost-conscious deployments with moderate complexity. | Still under development. |

GPT 4o Mini will cater to use cases where speed and cost-efficiency are prioritized, such as basic customer inquiries or lightweight conversational AI applications.


### Choosing the Right Model

Selecting the appropriate model depends on your business goals and the use case of your assistant:

1. **For High-Quality Responses**: Use **GPT 4.0** or **GPT 4o** for the best accuracy and reliability.
2. **For Speed and Cost**: Opt for **GPT 3.5** or **GPT 4o Mini** to balance affordability with responsiveness.
3. **For Intermediate Needs**: Consider **GPT 3.5 (0125)** or **GPT 4o Beta** as flexible options.

By configuring the model in the **Model Use** section of Agent Settings, you can tailor your assistant's performance to meet your specific requirements and provide the best possible customer experience.
