The **Model Use** section in the Agent Settings allows you to choose the Language Model (LLM) that best suits your needs. Currently, we support two models: ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT 3.5. Here's a detailed comparison of each model:

## ChatGPT 4

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Generates better answers and follows instructions more accurately. | High latency, resulting in longer response times. |
| Provides high-quality responses tailored to user queries. | Expensive compared to other models. |

ChatGPT 4 is ideal for scenarios where accuracy and quality of responses are paramount, and where budget constraints are not a limiting factor.

## ChatGPT 3.5

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                    |
| --------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Cost-effective option with lower latency.   | Tends to hallucinate more and may not always follow instructions as precisely as desired. |
| Suitable for applications where real-time responses are critical. | |

ChatGPT 3.5 is a more budget-friendly choice, suitable for use cases where immediate response times are essential, and where minor deviations from instructions are acceptable.

## ChatGPT 4o (Coming Soon)

We are currently working on introducing ChatGPT 4o, an upgraded version of ChatGPT 4. Stay tuned for updates on its availability and features.
