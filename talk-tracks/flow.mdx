title: 'Flow'
description: 'The `Flow` object exposes useful information about the current flow and allows transitioning between steps in the flow.'
---
### Properties:

### `current_step`:

```python
@property
def current_step() -> str:

# Usage

if conv.current_step == "Step 1":
	return "You are in Step 1"
```

- **Description**: Returns the step in the flow this conversation is in.
- **Type**: `str`

### `goto_step`:

```python
def goto_step(step_name: str):

# Usage

flow.goto_step("Step 2")
if conv.state.should_go_to_another_step:
	# We will go to "Step 3" because we only listen to the last
	# invocation of this function.
	flow.goto_step("Step 3")
```

- **Description**: Allows you to control the flow of the conversation, defining which step to go to and when.
- **Tips:** In flow functions, there is often information that you want to collect before moving on to the next step, a good pattern for making sure this information is collected before continuing is guarding the step transitions like so:
    
    ```python
    def flow_transition(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, first_name: str, last_name: str):
    	if not first_name or not last_name:
    		return "You need to collect the first and last name."
    	
    	conv.state.first_name = first_name
    	conv.state.last_name = last_name
    	
    	flow.goto_step("Next step")
    ```
    

# **Demo bot**

1. **Explore the Assistantâ€™s Features:**
    
    Begin by navigating to the chatbot assistant. Review both conversation flows and all available functions, paying special attention to the transition functions between flows.
    
2. **Initiate a Room Cleaning Request:**
    
    Start a conversation with the assistant by asking it to book a room cleaning for you.
    
    - Provide any date. The assistant will inform you that it cannot complete the request.
3. **Check Current Flow:**
    
    Ask the assistant what flow you are currently in.
    
    - It should call a function and provide you with the current flow information.
4. **Exit the Current Flow:**
    
    Request the assistant to exit the current flow.
    
5. **Request Towels:**
    
    Ask the assistant to order towels for you.
    
6. **Provide a Number:**
    
    When prompted, give it any number.
    
7. **Test Error Handling:**
    
    After the assistant repeats the number back to you, tell it the number is incorrect.
    
    - The assistant should restart the process and ask you for the number again.
8. **Confirm the Number:**
    
    Once the correct number is provided, confirm it with the assistant.
    
    - It should validate the number and then exit the flow.
