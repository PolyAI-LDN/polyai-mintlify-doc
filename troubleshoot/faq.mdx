This guide answers common questions about the knowledge base, rules, and assistant configuration. It includes practical tips and examples to help your assistant perform effectively.

## Knowledge base

### How should I structure a topic?
Each topic should have:
- **A clear name**: Use short, descriptive titles like “Refund policy” or “Store hours.”
- **Example queries**: Add 2–3 user questions to improve retrieval accuracy.
  - Example for *Refund policy*:
    - “How do I get a refund?”
    - “Can I return a product for a refund?”
- **Content and actions**: Separate what the assistant says (content) from what it does (actions).
  - Example for *Payment issues*:
    - **Content**: “Did you use a credit card or PayPal?”
    - **Action**: Trigger SMS with billing team details.

For more, see [how to set up actions](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction).

### Should I use smaller or larger topics?
- **Smaller topics**: Easier for reporting and analysis.
- **Larger topics**: Better for assistants using models like GPT-4o, which handle more context.

Balance scope and specificity based on your use case.

### What is the "description" field for?
The description field (or similar, like `faq_description`) provides content the assistant can use when responding. Some prefer to rename it to **content** for clarity.

### How can I handle clarification questions?
Add a disambiguation prompt in the content.
**Example**:
**Topic**: “Booking issues”
**Content**: “Can you confirm if the booking was made online or over the phone?”

### How do I manage out-of-scope queries?
Create an “Out-of-scope” topic or add instructions in global rules.
**Example response**: “I’m sorry, I can’t help with that. Please contact support.”

For details, visit the [FAQ page](/troubleshoot/faq).

## Rules

### What are global rules?
Global rules set consistent assistant behavior across interactions. Use them for tone, scope, and task-specific instructions.
**Examples**:
- “Always remain professional.”
- “Only answer questions about `<service>`.”

### Should I include examples in global rules?
Yes. Examples clarify how the assistant should behave.
**Example rule**:
“If the user asks for repetition, respond with: ‘Let me repeat that for you.’”

### How should I plan for risky scenarios?
Identify high-risk situations (like refunds or emergencies) and add clear rules or topics.
**Example for refunds**:
“Route all refund-related queries to a support specialist.”

For more on rules, see [agent rules](/agent-settings/rules).

## Actions

### What are actions?
Actions let the assistant perform tasks like sending SMS, calling functions, or triggering handoffs. They are defined in the knowledge base.
**Example use case**:
A user asks about refunds, and the assistant sends an SMS with a refund link.

For detailed steps, see [how to set up actions](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction).

### Can I combine multiple actions?
Yes. You can trigger multiple actions for a single topic, like sending an SMS and initiating a handoff.

### What happens if an action fails?
Set up fallback actions, like redirecting to a global FAQ or retrying with a different template.

## Personality and role

### How do I set the assistant's personality?
Avoid generic prompts like “You are a helpful assistant.” Use global rules or KB topics to set tone and boundaries.
**Example**: “Adopt a professional tone. Answer only questions about `<service>`.”

### Is defining a role necessary?
It’s helpful for clarity. Add this in the “About” section or as a global rule.
**Example**: “You are a virtual assistant for [Brand], focused on customer support.”

For role setup, see [about the assistant](../agent-settings/about).

## Technical considerations

### Does prompting affect ASR or TTS?
No. Prompts do not influence automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech (TTS). These systems are independent.

### Should I hard-code responses?
Avoid hard-coding where possible. Let the model generate dynamic responses for flexibility.
**Example for farewell messages**:
- **Avoid**: “Goodbye, have a great day!”
- **Preferred**: “Thanks for calling! Have a great day!” (generated dynamically).

## Practical tips

### How do I standardize KB entries?
Use this structure:
- **User queries**: 2–10 sample questions.
- **Model answer**: Concise and on-brand.
- **Actions**: Define workflows like SMS or handoff.

### How do I ensure consistency across projects?
Share templates for common use cases like refunds or SMS setups.

### How do I manage multilingual topics?
Write topics and prompts in all required languages and use embeddings models that support them.
