This guide answers common questions about the knowledge base, rules, and agent configuration.

## Knowledge base

Full page: [**Knowledge base**](/knowledge-base/introduction)

### How should I structure a topic?

Each topic should have:

* **A clear name**: Use short, descriptive titles like "Refund policy" or "Store hours."

* **Example queries**: Add 2–3 user questions to improve retrieval accuracy.

  * Example for *Refund policy*:

    * "How do I get a refund?"

    * "Can I return a product for a refund?"

* **Content and actions**: Separate what the agent says (content) from what it does (actions).

  * Example for *Payment issues*:

    * **Content**: "Did you use a credit card or PayPal?"

    * **Action**: Trigger SMS with billing team details.

For more, see [how to set up actions](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction).

### Should I use smaller or larger topics?

* **Larger topics**: Better for agents using newer LLM models, because they can handle more context.

* **Smaller topics**: Easier for reporting and analysis, or for agents using older models.

Balance scope and specificity based on your use case.

### How can I handle clarification questions?

Add a disambiguation prompt in the content.
* **Example**:
  * **Topic**: "Booking issues"
  * **Content**: "Can you confirm if the booking was made online or over the phone?"

### How do I manage out-of-scope queries?

Create an "Out-of-scope" topic or add instructions in global rules.
* **Example response**: "I’m sorry, I can’t help with that. Please contact support."

## Rules

Full page: [**Rules**](/agent-settings/rules)

### What are global rules?

Global rules set consistent agent behavior across interactions. Use them for tone, scope, and task-specific instructions.
* **Examples**:

    * "Always remain professional."

    * "Only answer questions about `<service>`."

### Should I include examples in global rules?

Yes. Examples clarify how the agent should behave.
* **Example rule**:
"If the user asks for repetition, respond with: ‘Let me repeat that for you.’"

### How should I plan for risky scenarios?

Identify high-risk situations (like refunds or emergencies) and add clear rules or topics.
* **Example for refunds**:
"Route all refund-related queries to a support specialist."

## Actions

Full page: [**Actions**](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction).

### What are actions?

Actions let the agent perform tasks like sending SMS, calling functions, or triggering handoffs. They are defined in the knowledge base, directly under the content field of a knowledge base item.
* **Example use case**:
A user asks about refunds, and the agent sends an SMS with a refund link.

### Can I combine multiple actions?

Yes. You can trigger multiple actions for a single topic, like sending an SMS and initiating a handoff.

### What happens if an action fails?

Set up fallback actions, like redirecting to a global FAQ or retrying with a different template.

## Personality and role

Full page: [**About the agent**](/agent-settings/about).

### How do I set the agent's personality?

Avoid generic prompts like "You are a helpful agent." Use global rules or KB topics to set tone and boundaries.
* **Example**: "Adopt a professional tone. Answer only questions about `<service>`."

### Is defining a role necessary?

It's helpful for clarity. Add this in the "About" section or as a global rule.
* **Example**: "You are a virtual agent for \[Brand], focused on customer support."
* **Example**: "You are a helpful hotel concierge, focused on resolving customer problems and managing reservations."

## Technical considerations

### Can prompting affect the way the agent talks, or how it understands speech?

No. Prompts do not influence automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech (TTS). These systems are independent.
