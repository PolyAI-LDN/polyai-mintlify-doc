The **SMS Messaging** section allows you to create and manage SMS templates that your assistant can send to callers during or after a conversation. To enable this feature, you’ll need to connect your Twilio account to your assistant.

### Setting up messaging

To get started with SMS messaging, follow these steps:

1. **Connect your Twilio account**:
   - Go to the **SMS Messaging** section in the **Build** menu.
   - Click **Connect Twilio Account**.
   - In the pop-up form, enter the following:
     - **Account SID**: This can be found in the "Account Info" section of your Twilio dashboard.
     - **Auth Token**: Available in your Twilio account settings.
     - **Twilio Phone Number**: Provide the phone number you wish to use for sending SMS messages.
   - Click **Connect** to link your Twilio account.

2. **Add SMS templates**:
   - Once connected, click **Add SMS** to create new templates.
   - Provide the following:
     - **Template Name**: A descriptive name for the SMS template.
     - **Message Body**: The content of the SMS message.
   - Save the template to make it available for use during conversations.

### Managing templates

All created SMS templates will appear in the SMS Messaging list. You can edit or delete templates as needed.

#### Best practices:
- **Clear and concise messages**: Ensure SMS content is simple and directly addresses the caller’s needs.
- **Personalization**: Use dynamic fields to include relevant information, such as the caller’s name or account details.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to local SMS regulations, such as opt-out options or consent requirements.

### Using SMS during calls

SMS templates can be triggered manually or programmatically during a conversation. For instance, your assistant might send a confirmation message
or share a link to follow-up information.

### Integrating call handoffs with SMS

When paired with **Call Handoff** functionality, you can streamline communication with the following workflow:
1. A call is routed to a specific agent or team using the **Call Handoffs** feature.
2. Your assistant sends an SMS to the caller, providing additional details or confirming the transfer.

By connecting Twilio and managing SMS templates effectively, you can enhance your assistant's capabilities and improve user experience.
