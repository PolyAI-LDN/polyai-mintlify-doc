#### Add SMS templates
Once connected, follow these steps to create SMS templates:
1. Click **Add SMS** in the **SMS Messaging** section.
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Title**: A descriptive name for the SMS template (e.g., "reservation_confirmation").
   - **SMS Body**: The content of the message. Ensure it is clear and concise.
   - **Phone Number**: Choose the Twilio phone number associated with this message.
3. Save the template to make it available during conversations.

### Managing templates
All created SMS templates are listed in the **SMS Messaging** section. You can:
- **Edit**: Modify the title, message content, or associated phone number.
- **Duplicate**: Quickly create a copy of an existing template for similar use cases.
- **Delete**: Remove unused or outdated templates.

#### Best practices
- **Clarity**: Keep SMS messages brief and directly relevant to the user's needs.
- **Personalization**: Use variables or dynamic fields (e.g., username or account details) to enhance engagement.
- **Compliance**: Follow SMS regulations, including providing opt-out options when necessary.

### Using SMS during calls
SMS templates can be sent manually or programmatically during conversations. For example:
- A confirmation SMS for appointments or purchases.
- Sharing a link to detailed information after a query is resolved.

### Integrating call handoffs with SMS
Combine [Call handoff](/call-handoff/introduction) functionality with SMS to streamline user interactions:
1. The assistant routes a call to a specific agent or team using **Call Handoffs**.
2. An SMS template is triggered, sending the caller additional details or confirmation of the transfer.
