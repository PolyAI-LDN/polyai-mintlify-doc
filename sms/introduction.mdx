The **SMS Messaging** section allows you to create and manage SMS templates that your agent can send to callers during or after
a conversation. To enable this feature, you'll need to connect your Twilio account to your agent.

## Setting up messaging

### Connect your Twilio account
1. Go to the **SMS Messaging** section in the **Build** menu.
2. Click **Connect Twilio Account**.
3. In the pop-up form, fill in the following fields:
   - [**Account SID**](https://help.twilio.com/articles/14726256820123-What-is-a-Twilio-Account-SID-and-where-can-I-find-it-): Find this in the "Account Info" section of your Twilio dashboard.
   - [**Auth Token**](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/authtoken): Retrieve this from your Twilio account settings.
   - **Twilio Phone Number**: Provide the number you wish to use for sending SMS messages.

### Important for US Numbers: Register for A2P 10DLC
If you are using a US-based Twilio number, you must [register for A2P 10DLC](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/a2p-10dlc#who-needs-to-register-for-a2p-10dlc) to comply with regulatory requirements. Twilio will block SMS messages if this is not completed.

#### Register
1. **Go to Twilio's A2P 10DLC registration page:**
   [Twilio A2P 10DLC Registration Guide](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260800720410-What-is-A2P-10DLC-)
2. **Complete brand and campaign registration** to comply with US carrier regulations.
3. **Wait for approval** (can take a few days).
4. **Once approved**, messages will send successfully.

**Troubleshooting:** If your messages fail to send, check the Twilio logs for these error codes:
- [**30034** - Unregistered Number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30034)
- [**30035** - Number Still Being Configured](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30035)

### Add SMS templates
Once connected, follow these steps to create SMS templates:
1. Click **Add SMS** in the **SMS Messaging** section.
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Title**: A descriptive name for the SMS template (e.g., "reservation_confirmation").
   - **SMS Body**: The content of the message. Ensure it is clear and concise.
   - **Phone Number**: Choose the Twilio phone number associated with this message.
3. Save the template to make it available during conversations.

### Managing templates
All created SMS templates are listed in the **SMS Messaging** section. You can:
- **Edit**: Modify the title, message content, or associated phone number.
- **Duplicate**: Quickly create a copy of an existing template for similar use cases.
- **Delete**: Remove unused or outdated templates.

### Using an SMS template

1. **Go to the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) build page**
    - Ensure you are on the knowledge base builder page.

2. **Add an action to a knowledge base card**
    - In any knowledge base card, click ["Add Actions."](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/send-sms)

3. **Set SMS action**
    - Prompt something like "If someone asks for more details, send" in the action box.
    - Click the + button on the right-hand side of the box and choose SMS > \{SMS template title created}.

    Here's an example of how to construct a prompt for your voice agent to send an SMS:

    ```plaintext
    After the caller confirms that they would like to receive an SMS message with further details, call {{SMS_template}} to send the SMS out.
    ```

4. **Click 'Save' and 'Publish'**

## Best practices
- **Clarity**: Keep SMS messages brief and directly relevant to the user's needs.
- **Personalization**: Use variables or dynamic fields (e.g., username or account details) to enhance engagement.
- **Compliance**: Follow SMS regulations, including providing opt-out options when necessary.

## Example: Integrating call handoffs with SMS
Combine [Call handoff](/call-handoff/introduction) functionality with SMS to streamline user interactions:
1. The agent routes a call to a specific agent or team using **Call Handoffs**.
2. At the same time, an SMS template is triggered, sending the caller additional details or confirmation of the transfer.

## Integrating SMS into a function

SMS can be triggered as part of a [function](/function/introduction) using [the `conv` objects](/function/classes/conv-object):
 - `conv.send_sms`
 - `conv.send_sms_template`

    ```python
    conv.send_sms("+15551234567", "Your request has been processed.")
