You can use the **Audio Management** tab to enhance the quality of your agent's voice by <Tooltip tip="TTS caching stores responses so they can be quickly accessed again, reducing the time and cost needed to repeatedly call the client.">introducing caching</Tooltip>
for commonly-used TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio elements, like greetings or transfer messages. This ensures consistent voice quality while reducing latency
during interactions.

## Benefits

- **Latency reduction**: Serve cached audio to minimize TTS latency.
- **Improved audio quality**: Dependable, reliable high-quality TTS generation using the cache.
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform voice quality and brand voice and tone across all your agent interactions.

## Getting started

To manage your agent's audio:
1. Go to the **Audio Management** tab.
2. Review all audio saved to the cache and monitor how often it has been used by the agent.
3. You can delete cached files and upload new ones to overwrite existing audio.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Edit options">
  You can edit the **stability** and **clarity** of the agent's voice specifically for this utterance. For more information on these settings, visit the [voice](/voice/introduction) feature page. The edit tab also includes sync <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" iconType="solid" /> and play <Icon icon="play" iconType="solid" /> buttons so you can test changes to the utterance live in the edit panel.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Add IPA syntax">
  You can add [IPA syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) to ensure your agent precisely pronounces industry-specific or non-traditionally pronounced terms, names, or domain-specific jargon.

<Tip>
**Why am I only seeing a few cached audios?**
The audio cache stores a file only if the same TTS is generated **at least twice within a 24-hour window**. This helps manage cache size and performance. If a particular utterance isn't used multiple times within that period, it won't persist in the cache and may appear missing.
To ensure key audios remain cached, consider generating them repeatedly or uploading static versions manually.

## Interaction style

The **Interaction style** settings feature lets you adjust your agent's response latency settings. Customize how quickly the agent
replies to balance speed and accuracy based on your project's requirements.

### Benefits

- **Customizable response time**: Choose from predefined modes tailored to your needs.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Minimize wait times or maximize response precision to optimize interactions.

### Interaction style settings

![audio-management-1](/images/interaction-style.png)

1. Locate the **Interaction style** section in the **Settings** menu.
2. Choose from the available modes:
   - **Swift Mode**
   - **Balanced Mode**
   - **Precise Mode**
   - **Turbo Mode**
3. Click on the bubble for your preferred mode. A brief description of the mode will appear.
4. Save your settings to apply changes. Your agent will adjust its behavior immediately.

### Performance characteristics

Each response mode is designed for specific performance needs:

#### Turbo

- **Latency**: 400ms
- **Description**: This is our ultra-fast mode, designed to make the agent more responsive by reducing the wait time
before it responds to a caller. However, this increased speed may cause the agent to interrupt more frequently. To address this, we recommend
enabling [barge-in](#barge-in) when using turbo mode. Barge-in helps balance the agent's rapid responses by allowing callers to regain control seamlessly.

#### Swift

- **Latency**: 1000ms  
- **Description**: Prioritizes speed, providing the fastest response times with higher interruption tolerance. Best for quick interactions
where speed is more valuable than precision.

#### Balanced

- **Latency**: 1400ms  
- **Description**: Offers moderate speed and balanced interruption levels. Ideal for general use cases requiring a compromise between
 responsiveness and accuracy.

#### Precise

- **Latency**: 1800ms  
- **Description**: Delivers the most accurate responses with minimal interruptions, at the cost of slower response times. Suitable for scenarios
where accuracy is paramount.

## Barge-in

The barge-in settings toggle allows you to decide if callers can interrupt agents. This can improve conversation flow and create natural, human-like interactions, but it can
also cause disruption to the call experience, depending on your user needs. Experiment with barge-in and latency modes to find a conversational
rhythm that suits you.

Functionally, this feature shortens the [Voice Activation Detection (VAD)](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/comparative-analysis-personalized-voice) time and reduces [response latency](/audio-management/introduction).

To test this feature, find **"Enable barge-in"** in the **"Settings"** menu.
