You can use the **Audio Management** tab to enhance the quality of your assistant's voice by <Tooltip tip="TTS caching stores responses so they can be quickly accessed again, reducing the time and cost needed to repeatedly call the client.">introducing caching</Tooltip>
for commonly-used TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio elements, like greetings or transfer messages. This ensures consistent voice quality while reducing latency
during interactions.

## Benefits

- **Latency reduction**: Serve cached audio to minimize TTS latency.
- **Improved audio quality**: Achieve high-quality TTS generation by utilizing the cache.
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform voice quality across all assistant interactions.

## Getting started

To manage your assistant's audio:
1. Go to the **Audio Management** tab.
2. Review all audio saved to the cache and monitor how often it has been used by the assistant.
3. In future updates, you'll be able to delete cached files and upload new ones to overwrite existing audio.

## Latency response

The **Latency Response** feature lets you adjust your assistant's response latency settings. Customize how quickly the assistant
replies to balance speed and accuracy based on your project's requirements.

### Benefits

- **Customizable response time**: Choose from predefined modes tailored to your needs.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Minimize wait times or maximize response precision to optimize interactions.

### Latency settings
1. Locate the **Latency Response** section in the Settings menu.
2. Choose from the available modes:
   - **Express Mode**
   - **Balanced Mode**
   - **Precision Mode**
3. Click on the bubble for your preferred mode. A brief description of the mode will appear.
4. Save your settings to apply changes. Your assistant will adjust its behavior immediately.

## Performance characteristics

Each Latency Response mode is designed for specific performance needs:

### Express mode

- **Latency**: 1000ms  
- **Description**: Prioritizes speed, providing the fastest response times with higher interruption tolerance. Best for quick interactions
where speed is more valuable than precision.

### Balanced mode

- **Latency**: 1400ms  
- **Description**: Offers moderate speed and balanced interruption levels. Ideal for general use cases requiring a compromise between
 responsiveness and accuracy.

### Precision mode

- **Latency**: 1800ms  
- **Description**: Delivers the most accurate responses with minimal interruptions, at the cost of slower response times. Suitable for scenarios
where accuracy is paramount.
