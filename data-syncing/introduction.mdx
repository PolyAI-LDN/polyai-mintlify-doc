You can use several methods to store large audio files and lengthy transcriptions, as well as retrieve them for analysis and practical use.

This section covers the tools and endpoints designed to synchronize conversation metadata and transcripts between PolyAI
systems and client infrastructure.

This section covers:

1. [**Handoff States**](conversations-api/handoff-states)
   - Use the [**Conversation API**](/api-reference/introduction) to manage real-time state sharing for conversation handoffs,
   so there is no delay in communication between automated systems and live agents.

2. [**List Conversations**](conversations-api/list-conversations)
   - Use the [**Conversation API**](/api-reference/introduction) to retrieve filtered lists of conversation transcripts, including metadata
   and identifiers. Use these transcripts to support monitoring and analysis of large data sets.

3. [**Portal Transcripts**](portal-transcripts)
   - You can access conversation transcripts and recordings directly in the [PolyAI Portal](https://platform.polyai.app/).

4. [**AWS S3 Integration**](s3-to-s3)
   - Sync data between your system and PolyAI using [**AWS S3 buckets**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for scalable, high-performance
   storage solutions. Perfect for large-scale or long term data handling scenarios.

| **Tool**                 | **Purpose**                                                                                   | **Provides Audio?** | **Provides Text (Transcripts)?** | **Best Use Cases**                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Handoff States**       | Monitor and trigger real-time state transitions for handoffs between automated and live agents. | No                  | No                                | Ensuring seamless communication during handoffs. Not for audio or transcript retrieval, but critical for conversation flow. |
| **List Conversations**   | Retrieve filtered lists of conversations with metadata and transcript IDs.                    | No                  | Yes (IDs only)                   | Ideal for monitoring, reporting, or linking transcripts to external systems for further analysis.                      |
| **Portal Transcripts**   | Access and review conversation transcripts and recordings directly in the PolyAI Portal.       | Yes (No download)   | Yes                               | Quick manual review for quality assurance, compliance, and performance analysis. Not suitable for bulk handling.       |
| **AWS S3 Integration**   | Sync recordings and metadata to your AWS S3 environment for scalable storage and analysis.     | Yes (Downloadable)  | Yes                               | Large-scale or long term storage needs, especially for compliance-heavy industries requiring both audio and transcripts. |

- **Audio only**: Use Portal Transcripts for quick access or a customized AWS S3 integration with downloadable audio files.
- **Text only**: Use list conversations to retrieve transcript IDs and link them to conversation data. Portal transcripts also provides manual access to text.
- **Audio and text combined**: Use AWS S3 integration to download both recordings and transcripts for complete access. Alternatively, combine List Conversations (transcript IDs) with Portal Transcripts (manual access).
