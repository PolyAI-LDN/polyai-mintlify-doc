There are various methods for both managing the storage of large audio files and lengthy transcriptions, as well as
retrieving them from storage for analysis and use.

This section covers the tools and endpoints designed to synchronize conversation metadata and transcripts between PolyAI
systems and client infrastructure.

This section covers:

1. [**Handoff States**](conversations-api/handoff-states)
   - Use the [**Conversation API**](/api-reference/introduction) to manage real-time state sharing during conversation handoffs,
   ensuring smooth transitions between automated systems and live agents.

2. [**List Conversations**](conversations-api/list-conversations)
   - Use the [**Conversation API**](/api-reference/introduction) to retrieve a structured list of conversations, including
    metadata and identifiers. This is ideal for monitoring, analysis, and integration with client-side reporting systems.

3. [**Portal Transcripts**](portal-transcripts)
   - Access detailed conversation transcripts directly using the [PolyAI Portal](https://platform.polyai.app/). This enables
   easy review of historical interactions for quality assurance, compliance, and performance insights.

4. [**AWS S3 Integration**](s3-to-s3)
   - Sync data between your system and PolyAI using [**AWS S3 buckets**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for scalable, high-performance
   storage solutions. Perfect for batch processing or large-scale data handling.
