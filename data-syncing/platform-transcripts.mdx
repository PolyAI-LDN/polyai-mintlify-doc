Use transcripts in the PolyAI platform as a no-code way to straightforwardly access and review call transcripts and recordings.

For programmatic access to transcripts, refer to [List Conversations](list-conversations).

## Accessing transcripts on the PolyAI platform

To view conversation transcripts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Conversations Log** in the PolyAI Portal.
2. Use the **Filters** option to narrow your search based on:
   - **Time Range**: Filter by start and end times.
   - **Call Details**: Search by call number or customer identifier.
   - **Conversation ID (Call SID)**: Use the unique system-generated identifier for precision.
3. Select a conversation to view its full details, including audio playback and transcript.

### Transcript details

Each transcript includes:
- **Metadata**:
  - Start and end times, call duration, and language used.
  - For Twilio numbers, the [Call SID](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223180488-What-is-a-Call-SID) for identifying the interaction.
  - Caller and recipient phone numbers.
- **Speaker Segmentation**:
  - Clear delineation between customer and assistant speech, including timestamps for each utterance.
- **Handoff Information**:
  - Transition details for live agent handoffs, such as handoff state, agent ID, and timestamps.
- **Audio Playback**:
