The **handoff states** feature in the PolyAI platform allows you to monitor and manage transitions between automated assistants and live agents. This page explains when to use the handoff-related APIs.

For detailed API specifications, refer to the [Get Handoff State API documentation](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-handoff). For information about
using handoff states in your Jupiter deployment, visit:

* [The Twilio integration guide](/telephony/twilio-how-to-handoff#handoff-integration)

## When to use handoff states

The **handoff states** API ensures effective management of live agent transitions during conversations. Use it to:

- Retrieve the current state of a handoff, such as `handoff_initiated`, `handoff_completed`, or `handoff_failed`.
- Monitor handoff processes for quality assurance and troubleshooting.
- Synchronize metadata with external systems, like CCaaS platforms, so agents have complete conversational context.

By tracking handoff states, you can improve operational efficiency and maintain seamless communication during transitions.

## Handoff states overview

The API returns the following handoff states to indicate the current stage of a transition:

| State                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `handoff_initiated`  | The handoff process has started, transitioning the call to a live agent.    |
| `handoff_completed`  | The handoff process has successfully connected the call to a live agent.    |
| `handoff_failed`     | The handoff process failed, and the call remains with the assistant.        |

These states provide real-time visibility and enable workflows like automated retries or fallback mechanisms.

## Accessing handoff state data

The **Get Handoff State** endpoint retrieves the current handoff state of a conversation using either:
- Shared IDs that are used in both the PolyAI and client system (`shared_id`)
- The PolyAI-generated conversation IDs (`id`)

If both IDs are provided, the API prioritizes the `shared_id`.

For full details on parameters, headers, and error codes, refer to the [Get Handoff State API documentation](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-handoff).

### SIP Header handoff

In some cases, metadata related to the handoff is included in SIP headers when calls are passed back to the contact center.
SIP headers can include all necessary metadata, such as agent IDs and handoff states, during transitions.

## Best practices

Visit the [Handoff state](/knowledge-based/how-to-setup-action/handoff) feature page for more information about integrating handoff states into your Jupiter deployment.

1. **Prioritize Shared IDs**: Use `shared_id` whenever possible for consistency with internal systems. If both `id` and `shared_id` are available, the API defaults to the `shared_id`.
2. **Monitor Handoff Failures**: Track the `handoff_failed` state to trigger automated retries or fallback processes, ensuring smooth customer experiences.
3. **Integrate with CCaaS Platforms**: Synchronize metadata with platforms like Genesys or LivePerson to give agents full visibility into conversation histories.
