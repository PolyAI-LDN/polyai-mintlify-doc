The **List Conversations** feature is a cornerstone of PolyAI’s data synchronization framework. It enables you to retrieve structured lists of conversations, complete with metadata, timestamps, and states. This functionality integrates seamlessly with other data syncing processes, supporting use cases such as real-time monitoring, analytics, and integration with external platforms like CCaaS or BI tools.

For technical details and API specifications, refer to the [Get Conversation API documentation](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversation).

## How List Conversations Supports Data Synchronization

The **List Conversations API** streamlines the retrieval of key interaction data, allowing you to monitor conversation progress, sync metadata, and connect with related resources such as transcripts or handoff states. This tool is essential for businesses seeking to integrate PolyAI’s platform into their reporting and operational workflows.

Conversation IDs retrieved through this API serve as anchors for linking additional data types, such as transcripts, call recordings, and handoff metadata. These integrations create a cohesive pipeline for managing and analyzing interaction data.

## Push and Pull API Models

PolyAI supports both **push** and **pull API** models for conversation data synchronization, offering flexibility for different system architectures:

- **Pull API**: Retrieve metadata on-demand by making requests to the List Conversations endpoint. This approach is ideal for periodic data collection or when updates are less time-sensitive.

- **Push API**: Configure PolyAI to automatically send updates (e.g., new conversations, completed interactions) to your system in real time. Push APIs are particularly suited to event-driven workflows or live dashboards requiring immediate updates.

### Best Practices for Push vs. Pull

1. **Use Pull APIs** for periodic reporting or when your system doesn’t require real-time updates.
2. **Use Push APIs** for real-time synchronization, such as integrating with CCaaS platforms like LivePerson or Genesys.
3. Evaluate your system’s requirements to determine the most efficient API model for your workflow.

## Working with Transcripts and Handoff Metadata

### Linking Conversations to Transcripts

Conversation IDs retrieved via this API can be used to access full transcripts through the [Portal Transcripts](portal-transcripts) feature. This enables you to review conversations for compliance, training, or analytics purposes. For bulk needs, consider integrating transcript data using the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) solution.

### Managing Handoff Metadata

Handoff metadata, such as agent IDs and timestamps, provides critical context for live agent transitions. This data can be synced with CCaaS platforms, ensuring agents have complete visibility into the customer’s interaction history. Use `state` filters in the API to prioritize completed conversations for metadata extraction.

## Integration into Data Sharing Workflows

The **List Conversations API** integrates into broader data-sharing workflows, facilitating seamless interaction management:

1. **Portal Integration**: Use the PolyAI Portal for manual access to conversation lists and ad-hoc reporting.
2. **End of Call API Download**: Automate post-conversation metadata retrieval using push or pull APIs.
3. **Handoff Metadata Sync**: Enable CCaaS platforms to access conversation history for smoother agent transitions.
4. **Bulk Data Syncing**: For high-volume operations, leverage the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) integration for scalable data transfers.
