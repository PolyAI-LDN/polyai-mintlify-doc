description: "Retrieve and synchronize conversation metadata using the List Conversations API."
---

The **List Conversations** feature is central to PolyAI’s data synchronization framework. It enables you to retrieve structured lists of conversations, complete with metadata, timestamps, and states. This functionality supports real-time monitoring, analytics, and seamless integration with external platforms like CCaaS or BI tools, ensuring effective data management and operational insights.

For technical details and API specifications, refer to the [Get Conversation API documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversation).

## Supporting Data Synchronization with List Conversations

The **List Conversations API** simplifies the retrieval of key interaction data, helping businesses monitor conversation progress, sync metadata, and link to related resources such as transcripts or handoff states. By providing unique conversation IDs, it acts as a foundation for creating cohesive workflows that combine transcripts, recordings, and metadata into actionable pipelines.

## Push and Pull API Models

PolyAI supports both **push** and **pull API** models, offering flexible synchronization options:

- **Pull API**: On-demand metadata retrieval through the List Conversations endpoint. Ideal for periodic data collection or workflows where updates are less time-sensitive.
- **Push API**: Automatically sends updates (e.g., new conversations or completed interactions) to your system in real time. Best suited for event-driven architectures or live dashboards requiring immediate updates.

### Best Practices for API Usage

1. **Pull API**: Use this model for scheduled reporting or when real-time updates are unnecessary.
2. **Push API**: Leverage push updates for real-time synchronization in dynamic environments, such as live agent dashboards or CCaaS platforms.
3. Assess your system’s requirements to determine whether a push or pull model best aligns with your workflow and data processing needs.

## Linking Transcripts and Metadata

### Accessing Transcripts

Use conversation IDs from the List Conversations API to retrieve full transcripts via the [Portal Transcripts](portal-transcripts) feature. For large-scale data handling, integrate with the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) solution to automate transcript downloads.

### Managing Handoff Metadata

Handoff metadata provides critical context, such as agent IDs and timestamps, for live agent transitions. This data ensures smooth integrations with CCaaS platforms by equipping agents with the necessary interaction history. Use API filters, such as `state`, to prioritize completed conversations for metadata extraction.

## Integration into Data Workflows

The **List Conversations API** fits seamlessly into larger data-sharing workflows, enabling efficient interaction management:

1. **Manual Access via the Portal**: View conversation lists and metadata directly in the PolyAI Portal for ad-hoc reporting.
2. **End of Call Metadata Retrieval**: Automate metadata syncing after conversations using push or pull APIs.
3. **Handoff Metadata Integration**: Provide CCaaS platforms with a comprehensive history of interactions for smoother transitions to live agents.
4. **Bulk Data Transfers**: Use the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) solution for high-volume data storage and retrieval needs.
