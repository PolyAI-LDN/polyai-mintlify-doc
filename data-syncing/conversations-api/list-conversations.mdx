description: "Overview of the List Conversations feature for managing and syncing conversation metadata."
---

The **List Conversations** feature is central to managing and syncing conversation metadata within PolyAI's platform. This page focuses on how this functionality integrates into larger data syncing workflows, emphasizing use cases, best practices, and related processes like **chat data sharing**, **transcripts**, and **handoff metadata**.

For detailed API specifications, refer to the [Get Conversation API documentation](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversation).

## How List Conversations Fits Into Data Syncing

### Use Cases

* **Conversation Monitoring**: Retrieve lists of conversations to track their states (e.g., `completed`, `in_progress`) and timestamps.

* **Data Synchronization**: Enable downstream systems (e.g., CCaaS platforms) to pull or push metadata for reporting, compliance, and analytics.

* **Transcript Linking**: Use the conversation IDs retrieved here to fetch associated transcripts or other data.

### Process Integration

From the **Chat Data Sharing** diagram:

* **Transcripts**: The conversation IDs retrieved from this endpoint link to specific transcript data.

* **End of Call API Download**: This complements **List Conversations** by allowing metadata and transcripts to be downloaded once conversations conclude, supporting both **push** and **pull API** models.

* **Handoff Metadata**: Use this in tandem with **handoff-states** to extract relevant metadata for live agent transitions.

## Push vs. Pull APIs

PolyAI supports flexible data syncing through **push** and **pull APIs**:

* **Pull API**: Use the List Conversations endpoint to retrieve metadata on-demand. Ideal for systems that periodically query the data for updates.

* **Push API**: Automate the process by configuring PolyAI to push updates (e.g., new conversations, completed handoffs) to your system. This is particularly useful for event-driven architectures.

### Best Practices for Push vs. Pull

1. **When to Use Pull APIs**: Suitable for periodic reporting, when the downstream system does not require real-time updates.

2. **When to Use Push APIs**: Ideal for immediate syncing needs, such as live dashboards or integrations with CCaaS systems like LivePerson.

3. **Action Items**: Determine whether push APIs are supported for your use case or predominantly rely on pull APIs.

## Working with Transcripts and Metadata

### Linking Conversations to Transcripts

Each conversation ID retrieved via this endpoint can be linked to its corresponding transcript. Use the **Portal Transcripts** feature to pull full conversation details for review, compliance, or training purposes.

### Handoff Metadata

When retrieving conversation lists, note that metadata associated with live agent handoffs (e.g., agent IDs, timestamps) can be integrated into CCaaS platforms like Genesys or LivePerson.

* **Best Practices**:

  * Use `state` filters to prioritize completed conversations for metadata extraction.

  * Consider bulk downloads (e.g., S3-to-S3 integration) for large-scale transcript syncing.

## Data Sharing Flow: Insights from the Diagram

The **Chat Data Sharing** diagram provides a high-level overview of how List Conversations integrates into the broader workflow:

1. **Jupiter App Downloads**: Use the PolyAI Portal to manually download conversation lists and metadata for ad-hoc reporting or quality control.

2. **End of Call API Download**: Automate data retrieval at the end of a conversation, using push or pull APIs.

3. **Handoff Metadata**: Sync data with third-party CCaaS platforms to provide a complete view of conversation states and transitions.

4. **Bulk Syncing**: For larger datasets, use **S3-to-S3** for scalable, efficient syncing.
