The **List Conversations** feature is central to PolyAI’s data synchronization framework. It enables you to retrieve structured lists of conversations, complete with metadata, timestamps, and states.

For technical details and API specifications, refer to the [Get Conversation API documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversation).

## Push and Pull

PolyAI supports both **push** and **pull API** models, offering flexible synchronization options:

- **Pull API**: On-demand metadata retrieval through the List Conversations endpoint. Ideal for periodic data collection or workflows where updates are less time-sensitive.
- **Push API**: Automatically sends updates (e.g., new conversations or completed interactions) to your system in real time. Best suited for event-driven architectures or live dashboards requiring prompt updates.

Note that for triggering instant, real-time communication updates, it is recommended to use [handoff states](handoff-states).

### Best practices

1. **Pull API**: Use this model for scheduled reporting or when real-time updates are unnecessary.
2. **Push API**: Leverage push updates for real-time synchronization in dynamic environments, such as live agent dashboards or CCaaS platforms.
3. Assess your system’s requirements to determine whether a push or pull model best aligns with your workflow and data processing needs.

## Linking transcripts and metadata

### Accessing transcripts

Use conversation IDs from the List Conversations API to retrieve full transcripts via the [Portal Transcripts](portal-transcripts) feature. For large-scale data handling, integrate with the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) solution to automate transcript downloads.

### Managing handoff metadata

Handoff metadata provides critical context, such as agent IDs and timestamps, for live agent transitions. This data ensures smooth
integrations with contact centers by equipping your agents with the necessary interaction history to help the customer, live.

For more information, visit the [handoff states](handoff-states) page.

## Integration with data workflows

The **List Conversations API** fits into larger data-sharing workflows:

1. **Manual Access using Portal**: View conversation lists and metadata directly in the PolyAI Portal for ad-hoc reporting.
2. **End of Call Metadata Retrieval**: Automate metadata syncing after conversations using push or pull APIs.
3. **Handoff Metadata Integration**: Provide CCaaS platforms with a comprehensive history of interactions for smoother transitions to live agents.
4. **Bulk Data Transfers**: Use the [S3-to-S3](s3-to-s3) solution for high-volume data storage and retrieval needs.
