The **Portal Transcripts** feature enables you to access and analyze detailed transcripts of customer conversations directly within the PolyAI platform. It is designed to provide transparency into interactions, support quality assurance processes, and meet compliance requirements. 

For programmatic access to transcripts, refer to related APIs such as [List Conversations](./list-conversations.mdx) or [S3-to-S3 Integration](./s3-to-s3.mdx).

## Accessing Transcripts in the Portal

1. Navigate to the **Conversations Log** in the PolyAI Portal.
2. Use the **Filters** option to search for conversations based on:
   - Start and end time.
   - Call number or customer identifier.
   - Call SID (unique conversation ID).
3. Select a specific conversation to open its transcript.

### Transcript Details

Each transcript entry includes:
- **Metadata**:
  - Start time, end time, and duration.
  - Call SID (system-generated unique identifier).
  - Agent or assistant name.
- **Speaker Segmentation**:
  - Clear delineation between customer and assistant speech, with timestamps for each utterance.
- **Handoff Details**:
  - Information about live agent transitions, including handoff state, agent ID, and timestamp.

## Use Cases for Portal Transcripts

1. **Compliance**:
   - Retain records of customer conversations for regulatory purposes (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
   - Review transcripts to verify adherence to policies and standards.

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Use transcripts to evaluate the assistant's performance and identify areas for improvement.
   - Monitor live agent handoffs for consistency and customer satisfaction.

3. **Operational Insights**:
   - Analyze customer interactions for trends, sentiment, and resolution outcomes.
   - Link transcripts with conversation metadata to generate reports or training data.

## Best Practices

1. **Filter for Relevant Data**: Use time-based and state-based filters to locate specific conversations quickly.
2. **Monitor Handoff Events**: Review conversations involving handoffs to live agents to ensure seamless transitions.
3. **Combine with API Access**: For bulk operations or programmatic integration, use the [List Conversations](./list-conversations.mdx) and [S3-to-S3 Integration](./s3-to-s3.mdx) APIs.
