The **S3-to-S3 Integration** solution provides a secure and scalable way for clients to transfer call recordings, transcripts, and related metadata from PolyAI’s platform to their AWS S3 environment. This is a collaborative setup, where PolyAI’s engineering team works closely with the client’s engineering team to ensure seamless integration. It is particularly suited for organizations with strict compliance requirements or those handling large volumes of data.

## What is an S3-to-S3 Integration?

S3-to-S3 integration automates the transfer of data between PolyAI’s platform and a client’s AWS S3 bucket. This solution supports:
- **Call Recordings**: Retained for compliance, auditing, or archival purposes.
- **Transcripts and Metadata**: Synced for analytics, reporting, and operational insights.

Designed for high-capacity data sharing, S3-to-S3 integrations enable organizations to efficiently manage large datasets while maintaining the security and durability offered by AWS S3.

## Why Use S3-to-S3?

AWS S3 is an industry-leading storage solution trusted by organizations with critical data needs. S3-to-S3 integrations are particularly valuable for:
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Regulatory requirements such as HIPAA mandate the secure storage of call recordings for seven or more years. AWS S3 ensures these requirements are met with reliability and compliance.
- **Enterprises with Compliance Needs**: Companies needing robust data retention policies benefit from S3’s scalability, durability, and accessibility, making it an ideal choice for long-term storage.

This solution allows organizations to maintain full control of their data while ensuring compliance with stringent industry standards.

## How to Get Started

To set up an S3-to-S3 integration, follow these steps:

1. **Contact Your PolyAI Representative**: Initiate the process by discussing your data synchronization needs and verifying S3 compatibility.
2. **Collaborate on Configuration**: PolyAI’s engineering team will work with your team to configure, test, and validate the integration, ensuring IAM policies and data paths are properly set up.
3. **Explore Alternatives**: If your organization does not use AWS S3, contact PolyAI to discuss other secure data transfer options.

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Initial Transfers**:
   - During initial runs, verify IAM configurations and ensure source paths are correct.
   - Expect a small percentage of task errors during the first transfer due to race conditions. These errors are resolved in subsequent runs but should still be reviewed for potential IAM-related issues.
2. **Validate Data Regularly**:
   - Use AWS tools or the PolyAI portal to ensure recordings, transcripts, and metadata are transferring correctly.
   - Periodically audit transferred data to confirm its accuracy and completeness.
3. **Plan for Scalability**:
   - Ensure your AWS S3 bucket is configured to handle high-capacity storage and efficient retrieval to meet future growth needs.
