Contact PolyAI to set up an S3 integration and automate data synchronization for extended periods. This setup supports call
recordings for compliance or archival purposes and transcripts with metadata for analytics and reporting.

PolyAI's engineering team works directly with your team to configure and validate the setup. This solution suits organizations that
manage large data volumes or require strict compliance by simplifying the process of long-term (in many cases multi-year) storage.

## Why use S3-to-S3?

Amazonâ€™s [S3 setups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DataDurability.html) promise scalability, reliability, and
robust data retention. They guarantee secure, automated data handling for long-term storage needs. Some example use cases include:

- [HIPAA-compliant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/architecting-hipaa-security-and-compliance-on-aws/architecting-hipaa-security-and-compliance-on-aws.html) healthcare organizations managing patient data.
- Financial institutions meeting audit and legal compliance under frameworks like [PCI DSS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/PCI/).

## How to get started

1. [**Contact PolyAI**](https://poly.ai/contact/): Discuss your data transfer needs with your PolyAI representative.
2. **Collaborate on setup**: Partner with PolyAI's engineering team to configure, test, and validate your integration, including IAM policies and data paths.
