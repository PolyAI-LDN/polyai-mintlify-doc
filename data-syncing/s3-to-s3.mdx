You can sync call transcripts and recordings from PolyAIâ€™s platform to your AWS S3 bucket. This process involves configuring secure,
automated data transfers that allow your organization to store and manage interaction data directly within your own S3 environment.

## Why use S3-to-S3?

Amazon's [S3 setups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DataDurability.html) promise scalability, reliability, and
robust data retention. They guarantee secure, automated data handling for organizations with strict compliance and long-term storage
needs, like healthcare organizations managing patient data and operating within the bounds of [HIPAA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/architecting-hipaa-security-and-compliance-on-aws/architecting-hipaa-security-and-compliance-on-aws.html).

It is an appropriate setup for handling long-term (in many cases multi-year) storage.

## How to get started

1. [**Contact PolyAI**](https://poly.ai/contact/): Discuss your data transfer needs with your PolyAI representative.
2. **Collaborate on setup**: Partner with PolyAI's engineering team to configure, test, and validate your integration, including IAM policies and data paths.

If a custom AWS storage setup does not suit your use case, you can also access call recordings and transcripts using:

- [List conversations](list-conversations): Programmatically retrieve conversation metadata and transcripts using the Conversations API.
- [Platform transcripts](platform-transcripts): Review transcripts and recordings using the PolyAI platform.
