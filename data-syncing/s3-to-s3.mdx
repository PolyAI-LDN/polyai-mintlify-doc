The **S3-to-S3 Integration** automates secure transfers of call recordings, transcripts, and metadata from PolyAI’s platform to a client’s [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) environment. PolyAI’s engineering team works directly with client teams to configure and validate the setup. This solution is ideal for organizations managing large volumes of data or with strict compliance needs.

## What is an S3-to-S3 Integration?

S3-to-S3 integration enables automated data sharing between PolyAI’s platform and a client’s AWS S3 bucket. It supports call recordings for compliance or archival purposes and transcripts with metadata for analytics and reporting. This setup ensures secure, high-capacity data transfers while leveraging AWS S3’s scalability and durability.

## Why Use S3-to-S3?

AWS S3 offers scalability, reliability, and robust data retention capabilities, making it an ideal solution for organizations with extensive storage needs. S3-to-S3 integrations ensure secure, automated data handling while allowing full control over transferred data. This approach supports long-term storage and operational requirements with ease.

## How to Get Started

1. **Contact PolyAI**: Start the process by discussing your data transfer needs with your PolyAI representative.
2. **Collaborate on Setup**: Work with PolyAI’s engineering team to configure, test, and validate the integration, including IAM policies and data paths.
3. **Discuss Alternatives**: If AWS S3 is not an option, consult PolyAI for other secure transfer solutions.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Initial Transfers**: Verify IAM configurations and source paths during the first runs. Address any initial errors caused by race conditions or permissions issues.
- **Validate Regularly**: Use AWS tools or the PolyAI portal to confirm successful transfers and periodically audit data for accuracy.
- **Plan for Growth**: Ensure your S3 bucket is configured for scalable storage and efficient data retrieval as your needs evolve.
