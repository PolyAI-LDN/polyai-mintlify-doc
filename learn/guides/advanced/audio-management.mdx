title: Audio Management and the cache
sidebarTitle: Audio Management
---

Audio Management controls how Text-to-Speech (TTS) output is generated, cached, and replayed. Without understanding this layer, teams often think changes “didn’t apply” when they are actually hearing cached audio.

**What caching is (and isn’t)**
- Cached audio stores previously generated TTS so it can be replayed instantly.
- This reduces latency and keeps repeated phrases consistent.
- Audio is only cached if the **same utterance is generated at least twice within a 24-hour window**.
- One-off utterances will *not* persist in cache by default.

**Do**
- Open **Audio Management**.
- Review the list of cached utterances:
  - Greeting
  - Transfer / handoff language
  - SMS offer phrasing
  - Closings and confirmations
- For any high-frequency utterance:
  - Open it and review how often it has been used.
  - Adjust **stability** and **clarity** *for that utterance only* if needed.
  - Use the **play** button to preview changes.
- If an utterance must remain stable:
  - Generate it multiple times within 24 hours, or
  - Upload a static audio file to overwrite the cached version.

**Interaction style (response latency)**
Interaction style controls how quickly the agent responds after detecting user speech. This directly affects interruption rate and perceived naturalness.

Common modes:
- **Turbo** (~400ms): Extremely fast, higher interruption risk.
- **Swift** (~1200ms): Prioritises speed.
- **Balanced** (~1600ms): Default for most use cases.
- **Precise** (~2000ms): Slower, more deliberate, fewer interruptions.

**Barge-in**
Barge-in determines whether callers can interrupt the agent mid-speech.
- Useful for fast modes (Turbo/Swift).
- Can feel chaotic if enabled without careful phrasing and latency tuning.

**Verify**
- After any voice or phrasing change, start a *new* call session.
- Confirm you are hearing updated audio, not a cached version.
- Validate that turn-taking still feels natural after changing latency or barge-in.

[ ] Pronunciations

**Goal:** Ensure domain-specific terms are spoken clearly and correctly in Call.

Pronunciations are defined in **Rules** and applied globally. They modify how text is converted to speech, without changing the underlying text.

**When to use pronunciations**
- Brand names or product names that are mispronounced.
- Proper nouns (locations, people, departments).
- Numbers or IDs that need structured read-back.
- Any phrase where pacing matters for comprehension.

**How pronunciations work**
- Matching is done using **regular expressions**.
- Replacements can be:
  - **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet)
  - **SSML**, such as `<break>` for pauses
  - Regex **capture groups** (`\1`, `\2`, etc.) for reformatting.

**Examples**

IPA correction:
- Regex: `\bLouvre\b`
- Replacement: `/ˈluːvrə/`
- Case sensitive: `FALSE`

Phone number formatting with pauses:
- Regex: `(\d{3})[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(\d{4})`
- Replacement: `\1 <break time="0.5s" /> \2 <break time="0.5s" /> \3`

**Do**
- Add pronunciations incrementally.
- Test each change in Call before adding more.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness—overly complex regex is hard to maintain.

**Verify**
- Mispronounced terms are corrected consistently.
- Pauses improve comprehension rather than slowing the call excessively.
