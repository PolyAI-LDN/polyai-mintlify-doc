Congratulations! You have completed **PolyAcademy Level 2**.

You have now been introduced to **behavior**, **knowledge**, **speech**, and **control layers**.

You have:
- Added and refined **more complex Knowledge Base topics**, including multiturn and action-driven flows.
- Configured **global ASR behavior** to reduce misrecognition and unnecessary clarification.
- Applied **Response Controls** to regulate the agent’s own output and eliminate undesirable phrasing.
- Tuned **audio and voice behavior**.
- Used **Conversation Review and diagnostics** to understand why the agent behaved the way it did.
- Tested changes safely across **environments**.

You should now be able to answer the following questions without guessing:

- Why did the agent respond the way it did?
- Which KB topic, rule, response control, or variant was responsible?
- Where would I change this behavior — and *only* this behavior?
- How would I test that change safely before users see it?
- Where would I verify that the change worked?
