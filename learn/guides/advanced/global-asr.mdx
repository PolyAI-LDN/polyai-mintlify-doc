title: Global ASR
---


Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) determines what the agent *hears*. Every downstream system depends on this layer: Knowledge Base retrieval, routing, response control, and handoff logic. Small transcription errors here can silently break otherwise well-designed agents.

Global ASR configuration is where you correct *systematic* listening problems before compensating elsewhere.

### What Global ASR is for

Use Global ASR to:
- Reduce unnecessary clarification questions.
- Improve routing accuracy for calls.
- Stabilise KB selection for spoken queries.
- Correct recurring transcription errors at the source.

It is not a substitute for good KB design or clear agent behaviour rules. Think of it as sharpening the agent's ears, not teaching it new facts.

### Two tools you should understand

### 1. Keyphrase Boosting

Keyphrase Boosting biases the ASR model toward recognising specific words or phrases more reliably.

Use this when:
- A word is important for routing or actions.
- Misrecognition causes the agent to take the wrong path.
- Users consistently repeat themselves for the same term.

Typical candidates:
- Department names
  > “front desk”
  > “billing”
  > “room reservations”
- Product or service names
  > “bell desk”
  > “late checkout”
- Action-critical verbs
  > “cancel”
  > “confirm”

How to configure:
- Add the keyphrase exactly as you want it recognised.
- Start with Default bias strength.
- Increase toward Maximum only if errors persist.

Guidance:
- Bias strength is cumulative. Over-biasing many terms can degrade overall accuracy.
- Avoid boosting generic words like “room” unless they are routing-critical.
- Prefer multi-word phrases over single words when possible.

> Example
> If callers asking for the “bell desk” are frequently routed incorrectly, boost “bell desk” rather than boosting “desk”.

### 2. Transcript Corrections

Transcript Corrections rewrite text after transcription, mapping common errors to the intended phrase.

Use this when:
- ASR consistently hears the same wrong thing.
- Accents or homophones cause predictable errors.
- Brand or proper names are repeatedly mangled.

Typical use cases:
- Homophones
  > “copper” → “hopper”
- Accent-driven substitutions
  > “reef fund” → “refund”
- Brand names
  > “Hopper Consumer” → “Hopper”

How to configure:
- Choose a match type (substring or regex).
- Define the misheard expression.
- Define the corrected replacement text.

Guidance:
- Prefer narrow matches over broad regex.
- Avoid corrections that could unintentionally rewrite unrelated phrases.
- If unsure, test in Sandbox with real call audio before promoting.

> Example
> If “cancel” is sometimes transcribed as “council,” add a correction rather than increasing bias on “cancel” alone.

### A practical workflow

1. Review recent calls where:
   - The agent asked for repetition.
   - The wrong KB topic was selected.
   - Routing or handoff failed unexpectedly.
2. Identify the specific word or phrase that failed.
3. Decide:
   - Boost if the word is correct but under-recognised.
   - Correct if the word is consistently misheard as something else.
4. Apply the smallest possible change.
5. Test again in Call.
6. Promote only after confirming improvement.

### Common mistakes

- Boosting everything “just in case”.
- Using Transcript Corrections to fix KB design problems.
- Applying maximum bias globally without testing.
- Forgetting that local (flow-level) ASR settings override global ones.

### Verify

You're done when:
- Previously misheard phrases are transcribed correctly.
- The agent asks fewer clarification questions for known terms.
- Routing and KB selection stabilise in live call testing.
- Behaviour remains consistent after promotion between environments.

Global ASR tuning is iterative. Small, deliberate adjustments here pay off more than large rewrites elsewhere.
