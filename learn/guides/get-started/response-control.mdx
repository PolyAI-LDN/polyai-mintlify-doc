title: Response Control
---

Response Controls monitor the agent’s *own output* and stop or regulate specific phrases.

**What they are**
- String or regex-based checks.
- Applied after the model generates text.
- Used for safety, brand control, and UX cleanup.

**Do**
- Add a control that targets:
  - Redundant preambles (“Let me check…”, “Please hold…”).
  - Off-brand or disallowed phrasing.
- Configure:
  - A clear ID.
  - A precise regex.
  - Whether matching text should halt output or be logged.

<Tip>
Start narrow. Broad patterns are hard to debug.
</Tip>

**Verify**
- The agent no longer produces the blocked phrasing.
- Behaviour is consistent in Chat and Call.
