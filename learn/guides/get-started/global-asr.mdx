## 12. Global ASR

[ ] Improve how user speech is recognised, especially for domain-specific language.
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) determines what the agent *hears*. Errors here cascade into KB misses, wrong routing, and failed actions.

**Two main tools**
1. **Keyphrase Boosting**
   - Biases recognition toward important words.
   - Best for:
     - Product names
     - Department names
     - Routing-critical terms (“billing”, “refund”, “reservation”)
2. **Transcript Corrections**
   - Maps commonly misheard phrases to the correct text.
   - Useful for:
     - Accents
     - Homophones
     - Brand names that ASR consistently mangles

**Do**
- Review recent calls where the agent asked unnecessary clarifying questions.
- Identify words that were misrecognized.
- Add:
  - Boosting for terms that must be recognised correctly.
  - Corrections for repeat offenders.

**Guidance**
- Start with default bias strength.
- Increase only for critical terms.
- Avoid over-biasing; it can reduce recognition accuracy elsewhere.

**Verify**
- Previously misheard phrases are now recognised correctly.
- The agent asks fewer clarification questions for known terms.
