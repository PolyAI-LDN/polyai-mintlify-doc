Voice choice strongly affects trust, clarity, and perceived competence. A good voice setup makes the agent feel calm, intentional, and predictable — especially in call scenarios where users cannot re-read responses.

This step should be completed **after** agent behaviour is stable, but **before** serious call testing.

## Where this lives

- **Configure → Agent voice**

You will see two configurable sections:
- **Agent** (the primary speaking voice)
- **Disclaimer** (used only for legal or informational disclosures, if enabled)

## What you are configuring

Each voice entry has three layers:
1. **Voice selection** (who the agent sounds like)
2. **Weighting** (if multiple voices are used)
3. **Voice tuning** (stability, clarity, speed)

You can use a single voice or blend multiple voices together.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Select the agent voice

In the **Agent** section:
- Click **Change**
- Browse voices by:
  - Language / locale
  - Gender
  - Voice type (for example, PolyVoice vs standard)
- Preview each voice using the play button

Choose a voice that:
- Matches your audience’s expectations
- Sounds neutral and professional
- Remains pleasant over repeated listening

> Example (hotel concierge):
> - Language: English (United States)
> - Voice: Female, calm, mid-range pitch
> - Avoid novelty or character voices

> Example (retail support):
> - Language: English (United Kingdom)
> - Voice: Neutral, friendly, slightly upbeat

Once selected, click **Select**.

### 2. (Optional) Add multiple agent voices

You can add more than one agent voice and split usage between them.

- Click **+ Voice**
- Select an additional voice
- Assign a percentage weight (for example, 70% / 30%)

This is useful when:
- You want subtle variation across calls
- You are testing two voices in parallel

> Example:
> - Voice A (primary): 70%
> - Voice B (secondary): 30%

Avoid adding more than 2–3 voices unless you are deliberately testing variation.

### 3. Configure voice settings (gear icon)

Next to each voice, click the **Settings (gear)** icon to open advanced tuning.

You will see:

**Voice model**
- Leave as default unless advised otherwise.

**Stability (%)**
- Controls how consistent the voice sounds.
- Higher = more predictable, less expressive.

Recommended ranges:
- Call agents: 70–90
- Informational agents: 60–80

> Example:
> Stability: 80
> Result: calm, consistent delivery across long calls

**Clarity and similarity (%)**
- Controls how close the generated voice is to the original recording.
- Higher = more realistic, but slightly less forgiving.

Recommended ranges:
- Dynamic conversations: 80–95
- Scripted or repetitive content: 95–100

> Example:
> Clarity: 100
> Result: very natural, human-like voice

**Voice speed**
- Controls pacing.
- Default is usually correct.

Recommended ranges:
- Calls: 0.95–1.05
- Long explanations: slightly slower (0.95)

> Example:
> Speed: 1.05
> Result: efficient without sounding rushed

Click **Done** to save settings.

### 4. Configure disclaimer voice (if enabled)

If your agent uses a disclaimer:
- Expand the **Disclaimer** section
- Select a voice (can be the same or different from the agent)

Best practices:
- Use a clear, neutral voice
- Avoid expressive or casual tones
- Keep speed slightly slower than the main agent

> Example disclaimer text:
> “This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.”

> Example settings:
> - Stability: 85
> - Clarity: 100
> - Speed: 0.95

### 5. Preview real utterances

Before publishing, preview the voice using **real agent lines**, not generic samples.

Test:
- Greeting
- Clarifying question
- SMS offer
- Handoff offer
- Closing line

> Example preview phrases:
> “How can I help you today?”
> “I can send you a text with the link — would you like me to do that now?”
> “I can connect you to a colleague if you’d prefer.”

Listen for:
- Natural pauses
- Clear pronunciation
- No rushing or slurring

### 6. Publish changes

Once satisfied:
- Click **Publish**
- Changes will apply to the selected environment

Remember: voice settings are environment-aware. Always test in **Sandbox** before Live.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Using overly expressive or novelty voices
- Setting stability too low (causes inconsistency)
- Speaking too fast for phone audio
- Forgetting to preview handoff language
- Changing voices without retesting call flows

## Verify

After publishing:
- Make at least one test call
- Listen to:
  - Greeting
  - Mid-call responses
  - Handoff or SMS offers
- Confirm:
  - Voice sounds consistent
  - No awkward pacing
  - Audio matches expectations across turns

If something feels off, adjust **stability first**, then speed.

Voice tuning is iterative — small adjustments often make a big difference.
