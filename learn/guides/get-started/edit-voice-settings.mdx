title: Edit voice settings
---

Voice choice strongly affects trust, clarity, and perceived competence. A good voice setup makes the agent feel calm, intentional, and predictable — especially in call scenarios where users cannot re-read responses.

This step should be completed **after** agent behaviour is stable, but **before** serious call testing.

## Where this lives

- **Voice → Agent voice**

![set-up-project](/images/academy/voice-agentvoice.png)

You will see two configurable sections:
- **Agent** (the primary speaking voice)
- **Disclaimer** (used only for legal or informational disclosures, if enabled)

## What you are configuring

Each voice entry has three layers:
1. **Voice selection** (who the agent sounds like)
2. **Weighting** (if multiple voices are used)
3. **Voice tuning** (stability, clarity, speed)

## Step-by-step

### 1. Select the agent voice

In the **Agent** section:
- Click **Change**
- Browse voices by:
  - Language / locale
  - Gender
  - Voice type
- Preview each voice using the play button

Choose a voice that:
- Matches your audience’s expectations
- Sounds neutral and professional
- Remains pleasant over repeated listening

Once selected, click **Select**.

### 2. (Optional) Add multiple agent voices

You can add more than one agent voice and split usage between them.

- Click **+ Voice**
- Select an additional voice
- Assign a percentage weight (for example, 70% / 30%)

This is useful when:
- You want subtle variation across calls
- You are testing two voices in parallel

### 3. Configure voice settings (gear icon)

Next to each voice, click the **Settings (gear)** icon to open advanced tuning.

You will see:

**Voice model**
- Leave as default unless advised otherwise.

**Stability (%)**
- Controls how consistent the voice sounds.
- Higher = more predictable, less expressive.

Recommended ranges:
- Call agents: 70–90
- Informational agents: 60–80

**Clarity and similarity (%)**
- Controls how close the generated voice is to the original recording.
- Higher = more realistic, but slightly less forgiving.

Recommended ranges:
- Dynamic conversations: 80–95
- Scripted or repetitive content: 95–100

**Voice speed**
- Controls pacing.
- Default is usually correct.

Recommended ranges:
- Calls: 0.95–1.05
- Long explanations: slightly slower (0.95)

Click **Done** to save settings.

### 4. Configure disclaimer voice (if enabled)

If your agent uses a disclaimer:
- Expand the **Disclaimer** section
- Select a voice (can be the same or different from the agent)

Best practices:
- Use a clear, neutral voice
- Avoid expressive or casual tones
- Keep speed slightly slower than the main agent

> Example disclaimer text:
> "This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes."

### 5. Publish changes

Once satisfied:
- Click **Publish**
- Changes will apply to the selected environment

## Verify

After publishing:
- Make at least one test call
- Listen to:
  - Greeting
  - Mid-call responses
  - Handoff or SMS offers
- Confirm:
  - Voice sounds consistent
  - No awkward pacing
  - Audio matches expectations across turns

If something feels off, adjust **stability first**, then speed.
