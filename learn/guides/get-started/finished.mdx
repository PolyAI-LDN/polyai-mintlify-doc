title: Finished?

Congratulations! You have completed **PolyAcademy Level 1**.

At this point, you have a fully functioning agent with a solid, inspectable baseline. You’ve created the project, defined non-domain-specific behavior, added and validated multiple Knowledge Base topics, tested the agent in both Chat and Call, configured voice and audio behavior, and confirmed that changes can be safely tested and promoted through environments. Just as importantly, you’ve learned how to *observe* the agent: reviewing conversations, understanding why responses occurred, and tracing behavior back to configuration choices.

You should be able to answer the following questions without guessing:
- Why did the agent respond the way it did?
- Which KB topic (or rule, or variant) was responsible?
- How would I change this behavior safely?
- Where would I verify that the change worked?

If you're ready to add more functionality to your agent, try out [level 2 of the PolyAcademy](/learn/guides/advanced/add-complex-kb-topics).
