title: Create a project
---

We will start by creating a new Agent Studio project.

A poorly named or misconfigured project could cause confusion later, especially when environments and variants are introduced.

In Agent Studio, creating a project is a short sequence:

![set-up-project](/images/academy/setup.png)

## Create the agent

1. Select **+ Agent** to open **Create new agent**.
2. Fill out the fields carefully (these become your default baseline for all later testing):

   - **Project name**
     - Use a clear, descriptive name that won’t become misleading later.
     - Good: `Acme Support Agent`, `Webchat L1 Sandbox`, `Hotel Concierge (US)`.
     - Avoid: `Test`, `New agent`, or names that explicitly name an environment (`Prod`, `Live`).

   - **Response language**
     - Select the primary language/locale your users will interact in.

   - **Agent voice**
     - Pick a reasonable starter voice. You can always change this later.

   - **Greeting**
     - Keep it short and broadly reusable.
     - Aim for one sentence that works for both a chat bot and a voice agent.
     - Example: `Hi—how can I help today?`
     - Avoid over-specific or wordy greetings.

   - **Project ID**
     - Treat this like a stable identifier. It will determine the project URL inside Agent Studio.
     - Example: `my-shop-support-l1`, `hotel-concierge-sandbox`.
     - If you expect multiple similar agents, build a predictable pattern now.

3. Select **Create**.

## Confirm the baseline workspace

After creation, you land in the agent workspace. By default, this will be the **Knowledge base**, in an empty state ("You don't have any topics") with an **Add topic** button.

**Next**:
1. Confirm you can identify the agent you're in:
  - <input type="checkbox"  /> The header shows the agent name and language.
  - <input type="checkbox"  /> The agent is in **Draft** state.

2. Use the left navigation to check you can access:
   - **Build**
     - **Agent**: baseline behavior configuration (greeting/personality/role/behavior text).
     - **Knowledge base**: later, you'll learn to simple FAQ, SMS/handoff topic, and multiturn topics here.
     - **Variant management**: where you'll configure variants later (even if you ignore it for now, confirm it opens).
   - **Voice**
     - **Agent voice**: where you’ll configure assistant/disclaimer voices and preview changes.
   - **Configure**
     - **Environments**: where you’ll test and promote changes safely (Sandbox → Pre-release → Live, depending on your setup).
     - You may also see other configuration areas (Numbers, Settings, Configuration builder, Dashboards). You won't need to configure them for Level 1, but you may return to them later.

## Verify

![set-up-project-complete](/images/academy/setup-done.png)

- The project loads without errors and stays stable across page changes.
- You can access (at minimum):
  - **Agent** (baseline behavior configuration)
  - **Knowledge base**
  - **Variant management**
  - **Agent voice**
  - **Environments**
- The Knowledge base page shows an empty state with a clear call to action (for example, **Add topic**), indicating you're ready for the next steps in the checklist.
