title: Add a simple topic
---

A simple Knowledge Base (KB) topic answers a question in one turn. It does not trigger actions, ask follow-up questions, or route the conversation.

This lesson walks through how to define, write, and test a simple KB topic, which will be the foundation of a successful agent:

## What "simple" means

- Handles **one intent**
- Completes in **one turn**
- Requires **no clarification**
- Triggers **no actions**
- Works the same way in **Chat and Call**

A simple KB topic does not:

- Combine multiple questions
- Offer SMS, handoff, or routing
- Ask the user a follow-up question

If a topic needs any of those, it should be implemented as a [complex topic](/learn/guides/advanced/add-complex-kb-topic) instead. These will
be covered in more detail in **level 2** of the PolyAcademy.

## Before you start: define your intent

Answer these questions before creating the topic:

- What is the exact question being answered?
- Can a human answer it in one short response?
- Can users reasonably phrase this question in several different ways?

If the topic answers more than one question, split it.

**Example: single intent**
- "What time do you close?"

**Example: multiple intents**
- "What time do you close and do you have holiday hours?"

These should be two separate topics.

### Step 1: Choose a precise topic name

The topic name is the strongest signal for retrieval.

Good topic names:
- Describe one intent
- Are specific, not general
- Use `snake_case`

**Examples**
- `closing_time`
- `parking_cost`
- `pet_policy`

Avoid names that are broad or vague.

**Avoid**
- `info`
- `general`
- `shop_questions`
- `misc`

### Step 2: Write sample questions

Sample questions teach the retriever how users phrase requests.

Add **5–10** variations that reflect real speech. Include:
- Short questions
- Polite phrasing
- Informal or incomplete phrasing
- Call-style filler words

**Example: `closing_time` sample questions**
- what time is closing
- closing time
- when do we have to leave
- when do you shut
- what time do we need to be out by
- uh what's the closing time

Avoid:
- Repeating the same sentence with small wording changes
- Writing marketing-style language
- Including answers

### Step 3: Write the Content response

The Content field is the agent’s full response.

It should be:
- Short
- Direct
- Easy to understand when spoken
- Complete on its own

Use this structure:
1. State the answer clearly
2. Optionally mention one next step
3. Stop

**Example: `checkout_time` content**
> Checkout is at 11 a.m.
>
> If you need help with a late checkout, I can assist with that.

This works because:
- The answer comes first
- The response ends cleanly
- No action is triggered

Avoid:
- Explanations or justification
- Policy language
- Multiple offers or options

**Avoid**
> Closing time is at 6 p.m., which allows our cleaning team to prepare the store for the next day.

This reads well on a page but performs poorly.

### Step 4: For now, leave Actions empty

For a simple KB topic:
- Do not add Actions
- Do not reference functions
- Do not trigger handoff or SMS

If an action is required, the topic is no longer simple and should be rewritten as a [complex topic](/learn/guides/advanced/add-complex-kb-topic).

## Common simple KB patterns

### Static information

**Topic name**
`opening_hours`

**Content**
> We are open daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.

### Policy statement

**Topic name**
`pet_policy`

**Content**
> Guide dogs are allowed in the store. Other pets are not allowed.

### Location information

**Topic name**
`parking_location`

**Content**
> Parking is available in the structure beneath the mall entrance.

### Price reference

**Topic name**
`parking_cost`

**Content**
> Self-parking is free on weekdays and $5 an hour on weekends between 9am and 5pm.

## Verification

### Test in Chat

Ask the question using:
- Exact phrasing
- Informal phrasing
- Polite phrasing
- Abrupt phrasing

Confirm:
- The same topic triggers every time
- The response does not change
- No follow-up question is asked

Enable **Topic citations** to confirm which topic fired.

### Test in Call

Ask the same question out loud, including hesitation or filler words.

Confirm:
- Speech is transcribed correctly
- The response sounds natural when spoken
- The agent does not over-explain

If it sounds awkward to hear, shorten it.

## When a simple topic should become complex

Convert the topic to a complex pattern if:
- You need to offer SMS
- You need to offer handoff
- You need clarification
- The user’s response affects what happens next

Do not add partial logic to a simple topic.

## Final checklist

Before moving on, confirm:

- The topic answers exactly one question
- Sample questions reflect real user phrasing
- Content is short and speakable
- Actions are empty
- The topic behaves the same in Chat and Call
