title: Add a simple Knowledge Base topic
---

A simple Knowledge Base (KB) topic is the foundation of every agent. It represents **one interaction**: what users ask, and how the agent responds, with no follow-up logic and no actions.

If simple KB topics are not solid, everything built on top of them—multi-turn flows, SMS, handoffs, routing—will be fragile. This step is about teaching the agent to answer cleanly, consistently, and predictably.

## What “simple” means (and what it doesn’t)

A simple KB topic:

- Handles **one intent only**
- Completes in **one turn**
- Requires **no clarification**
- Triggers **no actions**
- Works equally well in **Chat and Call**

A simple KB topic is *not*:
- A catch-all for loosely related questions
- A place to explain background context
- A place to offer handoff or SMS
- A place to ask follow-up questions

If you feel tempted to do any of the above, you are no longer writing a simple topic.

## Before you start: define the intent

Ask yourself:

- What is the exact question being answered?
- Would a human answer this in one sentence?
- Could the user reasonably ask this in five different ways?

If the answer to any of these is “no,” split the topic.

> Example – good single intent
> “What time is checkout?”

> Example – bad combined intent
> “What time is checkout and can I stay longer?”

Those are two topics.

## Step-by-step: creating a simple KB topic

### 1. Choose a precise topic name

The topic name is the strongest retrieval signal.

Good topic names:
- Are specific
- Describe the intent, not the wording
- Use snake_case

> Good topic names
> checkout_time
> parking_cost
> pet_policy
> pool_hours

> Bad topic names
> info
> general
> hotel_questions
> misc

If you can’t summarize the intent in 2–3 words, the topic is too broad.

### 2. Write realistic sample questions

Sample questions teach the retriever how users *actually speak*.

Aim for **5–10**, and include:
- Short questions
- Polite phrasing
- Imperfect grammar
- Call-style filler

> Example – checkout_time sample questions
> what time is checkout
> checkout time
> when do we have to leave
> when is check out
> what time do we need to be out by
> uh what’s the checkout time

Avoid:
- Copying the same sentence with tiny variations
- Writing “perfect” marketing language
- Including answers

### 3. Write the Content response

Content should be:
- Short
- Direct
- Spoken-language friendly
- Complete on its own

Structure:
1. Lead with the answer
2. Optionally offer one next step
3. Stop

> Example – checkout_time content
> Checkout is at 11 a.m.
>
> If you need help with a late checkout, I can assist with that.

Why this works:
- The answer comes first
- The follow-up is optional
- No action is triggered yet

Avoid:
- Long explanations
- Policy justification
- Multiple offers

> Bad example
> Checkout is at 11 a.m., which allows our housekeeping team to prepare rooms for incoming guests and ensure a smooth experience for everyone.

That sounds fine in writing, but performs poorly in Call.

### 4. Leave Actions empty

For a simple KB topic:
- Do not add actions
- Do not reference functions
- Do not trigger handoffs
- Do not start SMS flows

Actions belong in **complex** topics only.

If you add an action here “just in case,” you are creating hidden coupling that will break later.

## Common simple KB patterns (with examples)

### Static info

> Topic name
> pool_hours

> Content
> The pool is open daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

### Policy statement

> Topic name
> pet_policy

> Content
> We allow dogs up to 50 pounds. A nightly pet fee applies.

### Location info

> Topic name
> parking_location

> Content
> Parking is available in the garage beneath the hotel entrance.

### Price reference

> Topic name
> parking_cost

> Content
> Self-parking is $25 per night.

## Verification: test it properly

### In Chat

Ask:
- Exact phrasing
- Sloppy phrasing
- Polite phrasing
- Abrupt phrasing

Confirm:
- The same topic is selected every time
- The response is identical or equivalent
- No follow-up question is asked

Turn on **Topic citations** so you can see which topic fired.

### In Call

Ask:
- The same question naturally, out loud
- With hesitation or filler words

Confirm:
- ASR transcribes correctly
- The response sounds natural when spoken
- The agent does not over-explain

If it sounds awkward to hear, rewrite it.

## When a “simple” topic stops being simple

Promote the topic to a complex pattern if:
- You need to offer SMS
- You need to offer handoff
- You need clarification
- The user might say yes or no

Do not force complexity into a simple topic.

## Why this step matters more than it looks

Most KB problems come from:
- Vague topic names
- Weak sample questions
- Overwritten content
- Premature actions

Teams often rewrite content repeatedly when the real issue is retrieval.

Fix the name and samples first. Always.

## Final checklist

Before moving on, confirm:

- The topic answers exactly one question
- Sample questions reflect real speech
- Content is short and speakable
- Actions are empty
- The topic works identically in Chat and Call

Once this is true, you’re ready to build on top of it.
