title: Add a simple Knowledge Base topic
---

A simple Knowledge Base (KB) topic answers one question in one turn. It does not trigger actions, ask follow-up questions, or route the conversation.

Simple topics form the base layer of every agent. If they are unclear or inconsistent, more advanced flows built on top of them will fail in subtle ways.

This lesson walks through how to define, write, and test a simple KB topic.

## What “simple” means

A simple KB topic:

- Handles **one intent**
- Completes in **one turn**
- Requires **no clarification**
- Triggers **no actions**
- Works the same way in **Chat and Call**

A simple KB topic does not:

- Combine multiple questions
- Provide background or justification
- Offer SMS, handoff, or routing
- Ask the user a follow-up question

If a topic needs any of those, it should be implemented as a complex topic instead.

## Before you start: define the intent

Answer these questions before creating the topic:

- What is the exact question being answered?
- Can a human answer it in one short response?
- Can users reasonably phrase this question in several different ways?

If the topic answers more than one question, split it.

**Example: single intent**
- “What time is checkout?”

**Example: multiple intents**
- “What time is checkout and can I stay longer?”

These should be two separate topics.

## Step-by-step: creating a simple KB topic

### Step 1: Choose a precise topic name

The topic name is the strongest signal for retrieval.

Good topic names:
- Describe one intent
- Are specific, not general
- Use `snake_case`

**Examples**
- `checkout_time`
- `parking_cost`
- `pet_policy`
- `pool_hours`

Avoid names that are broad or vague.

**Avoid**
- `info`
- `general`
- `hotel_questions`
- `misc`

If the intent cannot be summarized in two or three words, the topic is too broad.

### Step 2: Write sample questions

Sample questions teach the retriever how users phrase requests.

Add **5–10** variations that reflect real speech. Include:
- Short questions
- Polite phrasing
- Informal or incomplete phrasing
- Call-style filler words

**Example: `checkout_time` sample questions**
- what time is checkout
- checkout time
- when do we have to leave
- when is check out
- what time do we need to be out by
- uh what’s the checkout time

Avoid:
- Repeating the same sentence with small wording changes
- Writing marketing-style language
- Including answers

### Step 3: Write the Content response

The Content field is the agent’s full response.

It should be:
- Short
- Direct
- Easy to understand when spoken
- Complete on its own

Use this structure:
1. State the answer clearly
2. Optionally mention one next step
3. Stop

**Example: `checkout_time` content**
> Checkout is at 11 a.m.
>
> If you need help with a late checkout, I can assist with that.

This works because:
- The answer comes first
- The response ends cleanly
- No action is triggered

Avoid:
- Explanations or justification
- Policy language
- Multiple offers or options

**Avoid**
> Checkout is at 11 a.m., which allows our housekeeping team to prepare rooms for incoming guests and ensure a smooth experience for everyone.

This reads well on a page but performs poorly in Call.

### Step 4: Leave Actions empty

For a simple KB topic:
- Do not add Actions
- Do not reference functions
- Do not trigger handoff or SMS

If an action is required, the topic is no longer simple and should be rewritten as a complex topic.

## Common simple KB patterns

### Static information

**Topic name**
`pool_hours`

**Content**
> The pool is open daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

### Policy statement

**Topic name**
`pet_policy`

**Content**
> We allow dogs up to 50 pounds. A nightly pet fee applies.

### Location information

**Topic name**
`parking_location`

**Content**
> Parking is available in the garage beneath the hotel entrance.

### Price reference

**Topic name**
`parking_cost`

**Content**
> Self-parking is $25 per night.

## Verification

### Test in Chat

Ask the question using:
- Exact phrasing
- Informal phrasing
- Polite phrasing
- Abrupt phrasing

Confirm:
- The same topic triggers every time
- The response does not change
- No follow-up question is asked

Enable **Topic citations** to confirm which topic fired.

### Test in Call

Ask the same question out loud, including hesitation or filler words.

Confirm:
- Speech is transcribed correctly
- The response sounds natural when spoken
- The agent does not over-explain

If it sounds awkward to hear, shorten it.

## When a simple topic should become complex

Convert the topic to a complex pattern if:
- You need to offer SMS
- You need to offer handoff
- You need clarification
- The user’s response affects what happens next

Do not add partial logic to a simple topic.

## Final checklist

Before moving on, confirm:

- The topic answers exactly one question
- Sample questions reflect real user phrasing
- Content is short and speakable
- Actions are empty
- The topic behaves the same in Chat and Call
