title: Add a simple Knowledge Base topic
---

## 4. Add KB topic (simple FAQ)

[ ] Teach the agent one reliable, single-turn answer.

Create a Knowledge Base topic representing one interaction: both what users ask, and how the agent responds.

**For this step**
- Single turn.
- No follow-up questions.
- No actions.

**Do**
- Create a new KB topic with:
  - A **specific topic name**.
  - **5–10 realistic sample questions** written the way users actually speak.
  - A short **Content** answer:
    - Lead with the answer.
    - Add one optional next step.
    - Avoid unnecessary context.
- Leave **Actions** empty.

<Tip>
Retrieval relies heavily on topic name and sample questions. Improve those before rewriting answers.
</Tip>

**Verify**
- Ask the FAQ in multiple phrasings.
- Confirm the same topic is selected consistently.
- The agent answers in one clean turn.

## 3. Chat

- [ ] Use Chat as your first and fastest feedback loop.

Chat testing is where you refine behaviour before adding voice complexity.

**Do**
- Open **Chat** testing.
- Test three types of prompts:
  - A clear, expected request.
  - A vague request that should trigger clarification.
  - An out-of-scope request.

- Enable visibility for:
  - **Topic citations** (to see KB usage).

**Verify**
- Responses are coherent and on-tone.
- The agent does not loop or stall.
- Clarifying questions are asked only when necessary.

## 5. Call

[ ] Validate spoken behaviour early.

Voice introduces new variables: ASR accuracy, pacing, and interruption handling.

**Do**
- Start an in-browser call or use a test number.
- Make several test calls:
  - Ask the simple FAQ.
  - Ask something vague.
  - Ask something out of scope.

**Verify**
- Speech recognition is acceptable.
- Turn-taking feels natural.
- Responses are not overly long when spoken.
