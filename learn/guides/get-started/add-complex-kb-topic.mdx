## 6. Add KB topic (SMS + handoff)

[ ] Provide clear escalation paths.

This topic teaches the agent how to move the user forward when information alone is not enough.

**Do**
- Create a KB topic covering:
  - Requests for links, details, or instructions.
  - Requests to speak to a person.
- In **Content**:
  - Ask for consent before sending SMS.
  - Explain what the SMS contains.
  - Clearly offer a human handoff as an alternative.
  - Include a fallback for users who cannot receive SMS.

Example structure:
- “I can send you a text with the details. Would you like me to do that now?”
- “If you’d rather speak to someone, I can connect you.”

**Verify**
- In Call:
  - SMS offers are clear and explicit.
  - Handoff language is calm and unambiguous.

## 7. Add KB topic (multiturn FAQ)

Handle one case that requires clarification.

Multi-turn FAQs should be simple and controlled.

**Do**
- Create a KB topic that:
  - Asks **one** clarifying question.
  - Provides the final answer once clarified.
- Avoid turning this into a form or checklist.
- Keep **Actions** empty.

Good examples:
- “Is this for today or a future date?”
- “Is this about billing or technical support?”

**Verify**
- The agent asks the clarification once.
- It completes the answer after the user responds.
- It does not guess or loop.
