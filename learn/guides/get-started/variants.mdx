Variants let you maintain **one agent** while tailoring its responses for specific contexts—without creating separate projects or forking your build work. Think of a variant as a **named configuration profile** that can change selected content or settings depending on where or how the agent is being used.

Common reasons to use variants:
- **Site/location** (different branches, properties, campuses, stores)
- **Brand** (same company, different sub-brands with different tone or policies)
- **Region** (differences in hours, terminology, supported services, legal language)
- **Channel** (Chat vs Call wording; short vs spoken-friendly phrasing)
- **Audience segment** (B2B vs B2C, member vs non-member)

**What variants are**
- A **set of values** attached to a variant name (for example: `site_name = "Example site"`), used to customize how the agent responds in that context.
- A way to keep **shared logic and behavior consistent**, while allowing specific fields to differ.
- Visible during analysis: variants appear in Conversation review/diagnosis so you can confirm which context handled each turn.

**What variants are not**
- Not separate agents.
- Not environments (Sandbox/Staging/Production are about safe promotion; variants are about contextual behavior).
- Not a replacement for good Knowledge Base structure (variants should refine, not rescue, retrieval).

### How the Variant UI works

In **Variant management**, you typically see:
- An **empty state** when no variants exist, with a primary **Add Variant** button.
- A **table/grid view** when variants exist:
  - Each row is a variant (for example, `Site 1 (default)`).
  - Columns represent variant fields/attributes (for example, `site_name`, plus other fields your org has defined).
  - A search bar for finding variants quickly.
- An **Edit variant** panel (often a right-side drawer):
  - **Variant name (required)**: the label you will recognize in testing and reporting.
  - **Default variant** toggle: marks which variant is used when no other variant is selected.
  - Editable fields such as `site_name`, and any other attributes your configuration supports.
- **Import / Export** controls:
  - Useful for bulk setup (many sites/locations) and sharing configurations across environments or projects.

### When to introduce variants (and when not to)

Use variants when:
- You have **repeatable structure** but different values (different addresses, accessibility info, hours, policies, routing copy).
- You want to avoid copying the same KB topic content across multiple projects.
- You need to test and report on performance by context (variants provide a clean audit trail).

Avoid variants when:
- The differences are **so large** that you effectively have a different agent (new product line, new workflows, different intents).
- You are trying to solve a retrieval problem that should be fixed by better topic names and sample questions.

### Decide what a variant represents

Before creating anything, define one sentence your team agrees on:

> “A variant represents ____________________.”

Examples:
- “A variant represents a single hotel property.”
- “A variant represents a specific store location.”
- “A variant represents a brand under a multi-brand umbrella.”

This prevents “variant sprawl,” where variants become an unstructured dumping ground.

### Create your first variant

**Do**
- Open **Variant management**.
- Click **Add Variant**.
- Set:
  - **Variant name**: use a naming convention that scales (examples below).
  - **Default variant**: set one default so testing and production always have a predictable fallback.
  - **Key fields**: start with 1–3 fields that clearly affect behavior (for example: `site_name`, `address_short`, `phone_number`).

Naming conventions that scale:
- `site_001_downtown` (stable and sortable)
- `kansas_city` (human-friendly, consistent with internal naming)
- `brand_a_us` (if your dimension is brand + region)

### What to put into variants

Variants are most useful for content that is:
- Frequently repeated in calls/chats
- Specific to context
- Risky if wrong

Examples of good variant fields:
- Location identifiers: `site_name`, `city`, `region`
- Customer-facing facts: `hours`, `address`, `parking_info`, `accessibility_info`
- Escalation language differences: “connect you to the front desk” vs “connect you to an agent”
- Channel-specific phrasing (short, spoken-friendly alternatives for Call)

Examples of content you usually should *not* vary in variants:
- Broad agent role and overall scope (keep consistent across variants unless you truly operate different agents)
- Safety policies
- Core tone guidelines (small adjustments are fine; wholesale tone shifts are not)

### Test variants (minimum checks)

**Do**
- Switch to a non-default variant and run the same smoke tests you used earlier:
  - Simple FAQ (Chat and Call)
  - Multiturn FAQ
  - SMS/handoff topic phrasing (where relevant)
  - Any brand-sensitive language (greeting, disclaimers, closings)

**Verify**
- Switching variants changes **only what you intended** (for example, `site_name`, hours, location-specific copy).
- Core behavior remains consistent (no missing topics, no broken escalation language).
- In Conversation review/diagnosis, you can clearly see which variant handled the interaction.

### Operational tips

- Keep the number of variant fields small at first. Add fields only when you have a clear use case.
- Prefer storing factual, high-impact values (hours, addresses, names) rather than duplicating full KB answers.
- Use **Import/Export** when onboarding many variants at once; it reduces manual errors and makes review easier.
- Always maintain a **Default variant** so there is a safe fallback when context is missing or misconfigured.
