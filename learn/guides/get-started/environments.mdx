title: Environments

Environments allow you to test changes without affecting live users. A typical setup is:
- **Sandbox** → **Staging** → **Production**

**Do**
- Confirm which environment you are currently editing.
- Make all changes in **Sandbox** first.
- Run a smoke test:
  - Simple FAQ
  - Multiturn FAQ
  - SMS offer
  - Handoff
- Review what changed before promoting.
- Promote only after tests pass.

**Common mistakes**
- Editing Production directly.
- Forgetting to publish voice or audio changes before testing.
- Assuming KB changes propagate automatically without promotion.

**Verify**
- You can clearly identify the active environment in Chat, Call, and Conversation review.
- Behaviour remains consistent after promotion.
