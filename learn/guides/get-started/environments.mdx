title: Environments and versions
---

Environments are how you move safely from experimentation to production. They let you test changes, review impact, and roll back mistakes without exposing real users to unfinished work.

A typical deployment pipeline looks like this:

- **Sandbox** → **Pre-release** → **Live**

Each environment runs a specific **published version** of your agent. Draft changes do nothing until they are published and promoted.

## How environments work (mental model)

Think of environments as **checkpoints**, not branches.

- **Draft**: Your working state. Changes exist only for you.
- **Published version**: A snapshot of the agent at a moment in time.
- **Environment**: A place where a specific version is running and can receive traffic.

Multiple environments can point to the same version, but **only one version per environment** is active at any time.

## The Environments page

This page shows every published version of your agent and where it is currently deployed.

You’ll see:
- Version name or description
- Author and timestamp
- Which environments it’s active in (Sandbox / Pre-release / Live)
- An overflow menu for actions

Key actions from the menu:
- **Preview version** – load the agent exactly as that version behaves
- **Compare versions** – open a side-by-side diff
- **Rollback to this version** – immediately restore a previous state

## Sandbox

Sandbox is your **development and testing environment**.

**Use Sandbox for:**
- Writing or editing KB topics
- Adjusting rules and behaviour
- Changing voice settings
- Wiring or modifying actions, SMS, or handoffs

**Do**
- Confirm you are in **Sandbox** before editing.
- Publish frequently with short, descriptive notes.
- Test after every meaningful change.

> Example publish note:
> “Clarified late checkout KB and added SMS consent language”

**Verify**
- Chat testing reflects your latest changes.
- Test calls hit Sandbox numbers, not Live numbers.
- Conversation Review shows the Sandbox environment tag.

## Pre-release

Pre-release is your **staging / UAT environment**.

It should be treated as:
- Stable
- Reviewable
- Close to production

**Use Pre-release for:**
- Stakeholder sign-off
- QA review
- Final voice and pacing checks
- Regression testing

**Do**
- Promote to Pre-release only after Sandbox tests pass.
- Re-run your full smoke test:
  - Simple FAQ
  - Multiturn FAQ
  - SMS offer
  - Handoff
  - Out-of-scope refusal
- Review Conversation Review data again.

> Example UAT checklist:
> - Does the agent still ask for SMS consent?
> - Are handoff reasons correct?
> - Does voice sound identical to Sandbox?

**Verify**
- No unexpected KB topics are triggered.
- No new hallucinations appear.
- Behaviour matches expectations across channels.

## Live

Live is **production**. Real users are here.

**Rules for Live**
- Never edit directly.
- Never “just test something quickly”.
- Always know exactly what version is live.

**Do**
- Promote to Live only from Pre-release.
- Confirm promotion explicitly in the dialog.
- Monitor first calls after release.

> Example safe release habit:
> Promote → make one test call → open Conversation Review → confirm behaviour → continue monitoring.

## Publishing and promotion flow

1. Make changes (Draft).
2. Click **Publish**.
3. Add a clear description.
4. Version appears in Sandbox.
5. Promote to Pre-release.
6. Test and review.
7. Promote to Live.

Nothing skips steps. If it does, something is wrong.

## Comparing versions

The **Compare versions** view is your primary safety tool.

It shows:
- Added KB topics
- Modified content
- Removed actions
- Function wiring changes
- Sample question edits

Use this before every promotion.

> Example comparison insight:
> - Late checkout KB text changed
> - New SMS action added
> - No rule or voice changes

If you can’t explain every change in the diff, don’t promote.

## Rollbacks

Rollbacks are instant and safe.

**Use rollback when:**
- A KB topic misfires
- Voice sounds wrong
- Handoffs spike unexpectedly
- A release introduces confusion

**Do**
- Select a known-good version.
- Roll back.
- Confirm rollback.
- Verify with a live test call.

Rollback restores behaviour immediately without deleting newer versions.

## Phone numbers and environments

Each environment can have its own phone number.

**Best practice**
- Sandbox number: internal testing only
- Pre-release number: QA / stakeholder testing
- Live number: public traffic

This prevents accidental testing on production users.

## Common mistakes

- Editing while in Live without noticing.
- Forgetting to publish before testing.
- Assuming KB edits propagate automatically.
- Skipping version comparison.
- Using vague publish notes like “updates”.

## Verify you understand environments when:

- You can say which version is live without checking.
- You know how to roll back in under a minute.
- You can explain what changed between two versions.
- You never feel tempted to “just tweak production”.

If environments feel slow, that usually means they’re doing their job.
