## 2. Edit Agent Behaviour

It's important to establish a stable baseline before adding domain content.

Agent behavior defines how the agent speaks, what it is responsible for, and how it handles uncertainty. This should be done *before* adding knowledge.

**Where this lives**
- **Agent Settings → About**
- **Agent Settings → Rules**

**Do**
1. In **About**:
   - **Greeting**: short, neutral, reusable across contexts.
   - **Role**: clearly define what the agent is (for example, “Customer support assistant”).
   - **Personality / tone**: choose something that holds up under stress, not just ideal interactions.

2. In **Rules**:
   - Define what the agent **can** help with.
   - Explicitly define what it **cannot** help with.
   - Set response style:
     - Clear, plain language.
     - Short responses (1–3 sentences).
     - Offer next steps instead of long explanations.
   - Define escalation posture:
     - When to offer SMS.
     - When to offer a human handoff.
   - Add safety guidance:
     - Ask clarifying questions when needed.
     - Do not guess.
     - Do not invent policies, prices, availability, or hours.

<Tip>
Rules work best when they describe *what to do*, not just what to avoid.
</Tip>

**Verify**
- In Chat, the agent introduces itself consistently.
- It refuses out-of-scope requests cleanly.
- It does not invent capabilities when asked.
