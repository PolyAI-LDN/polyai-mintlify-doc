The **knowledge base comparison** tool provides a structured way to track changes between different versions of an assistantâ€™s knowledge base. It highlights modifications, additions, and deletions in a **side-by-side split diff** format, allowing teams to easily review content updates.

## Key features

- **Side-by-side version comparison:** View two versions of a knowledge base next to each other, with clear indicators for added, modified, or removed content.
- **Environment-aware tracking:** Compare versions across **sandbox, pre-release, and live** environments to ensure consistency before deployment.
- **Change attribution:** Identify which team members made specific changes, improving transparency and collaboration.
- **Sample question visibility:** Review how suggested user questions evolve over time to align with knowledge base updates.
- **Detailed content changes:** See how responses have been refined, expanded, or corrected, ensuring accuracy and quality control.

## How it works

1. **Select versions to compare:** Choose two versions of the knowledge base from the dropdown menu.
2. **Review differences:** Changes are highlighted in a structured format:
   - **<Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Additions** appear as highlighted insertions.
   - **<Icon icon="minus" iconType="solid" color="#D64F4F" /> Deletions** are marked for easy identification.
   - **<Icon icon="rotate" iconType="solid" color="#3B73D1" /> Edits** are displayed with side-by-side text differences.
3. **Assess impact:** Use the comparison view to evaluate changes before promoting updates to the next stage.
4. **Exit comparison mode:** Return to the knowledge base editor or switch to another version for further review.

By providing a clear, structured view of knowledge base modifications, this tool helps teams manage updates with confidence, reducing the risk of unintended errors in assistant responses.
