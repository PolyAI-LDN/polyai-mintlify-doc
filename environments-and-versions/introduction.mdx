The PolyAI Agent Studio uses project versioning to develop, test, and deploy updates to agents. Each version represents a
specific saved state, and you will have to verify and promote your project through all of them to **Live** before it is available in production.

## Creating a version

A <Tooltip tip="The state between the latest published version and ongoing changes. Drafts become versions upon publishing.">draft</Tooltip> version
is created whenever changes are made to an agent. A draft banner appears at the top of the page, allowing you to:

* **Delete**: Revert to the most recent published version.

* **Publish**: Save the draft as a version, optionally adding a description highlighting changes made and any notes for future
  collaborators.

Once published, the version becomes your active <Tooltip tip="Development environment where users build, change, and test versions of an agent.">Sandbox</Tooltip> deployment
and you can access it from the **Environments and Versions** page.

## Promoting a version

Promotion moves a version from one environment to the next. The environments include Sandbox,
<Tooltip tip="A staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT) before promoting to production.">Pre-release</Tooltip>,
and <Tooltip tip="The production environment. This is where the agent handles live traffic.">Live</Tooltip>.

### Pre-release

Pre-release is used for user acceptance testing (UAT). It is a stable staging area where versions are tested before being released to production.

1. Navigate to the **Environments and Versions** page.

2. Click the **Options Menu** next to the desired version.

3. Select **Promote to Pre-release**.

### Live

The live environment, also referred to as production, is where your agent handles real traffic.

1. Go to the **Pre-release** tab on the **Environments and Versions** page.

2. Click the overflow menu (three vertical dots) next to the version.

3. Select **Promote to Live**.

4. Confirm your selection by checking the box and clicking **Promote**.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Complete">
    ![release confirmed and live](/images/deployment/release-confirmed.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Rolling back to a previous version

If an issue arises with the promoted version, you can roll back to a previous version:

1. Navigate to the **Environments and Versions** page.

2. Select the **Options Menu** for the desired version.

3. Click **Rollback**.

4. Confirm the rollback.

Once complete, the system will notify you that the rollback was successful.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Initiate">
    ![initiate rollback](/images/deployment/initiate-rollback.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Confirm">
    ![confirm rollback](/images/deployment/rollback-confirmed.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing your agent

Main page: [agent Chat](/get-started/agent-chat)

You can test your agent by interacting with it in different environments. This helps identify issues and refine prompts.

1. Click the **Play Chat** icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

2. Select the environment containing the version you want to test.

## Assigning phone numbers

Each environment can have a unique phone number, allowing you to distinguish between test calls and live calls. To assign phone numbers:

1. Go to **Settings** in the left navigation.

2. Scroll to the **Numbers and Connections** section.

You can assign different phone numbers and SIP headers to your versions here.
