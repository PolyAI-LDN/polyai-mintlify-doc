Clicking on a conversation in the **Conversations** screen opens the **Conversation Review** page. This view provides a structured transcript alongside detailed metadata and diagnostic information for each interaction.

## Page overview

- **Conversation turns**: Shows agent and user utterances in chronological order. Each turn may display matched knowledge base topics where relevant.
- **Caller identity**: Displays the user’s email address if available (for web chat), or phone number if applicable.
- **Environment and metadata**: Includes information such as variant name, timezone, timestamp, environment (e.g. Sandbox or Production), and version ID.
- **Matched topics**: When topics from the knowledge base are referenced or triggered, they are shown as tags beneath the corresponding utterance.
- **Diagnosis panel**: Toggle to view the assistant’s internal reasoning, decision flows, or any system-level debugging tools (if enabled).
- **Category tagging**: Use the dropdown at the bottom of the screen to assign categories for reporting or follow-up.
- **Conversation status**: The end of the conversation is visually marked (e.g. "Ended conversation").

## Key functionality

- **Browse and filter**: Navigate and filter through past conversations using metadata, time filters, duration, tags, or flows.
- **Drill into specific calls**: View a complete transcript, inspect decision logic (if exposed), and assess how the agent handled the interaction.
- **Assign categories**: Manually label or tag calls for downstream use (e.g. QA review, escalation, training).
- **Export data**: Export transcripts and metadata for analysis, compliance, or reporting workflows.
