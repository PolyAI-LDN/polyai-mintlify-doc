<Tip>Looking for ways to manage transcripts and recordings? Visit the [Call Data](/call-data/introduction) section of the docs.</Tip>

Clicking on a conversation in the **Conversations** screen opens the **Conversation Review** page. This view provides a structured transcript alongside detailed metadata and diagnostic information for each interaction.
You can also **monitor in-progress calls live** — turns stream in real time, and duration updates continuously.

## Page overview

- **Conversation tabs**: Switch between *Live*, *Ended*, and *All* to focus on active or completed calls.
- **Conversation turns**: Shows agent and user utterances in chronological order. Live calls update automatically as new turns arrive. Each turn may display matched [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) topics where relevant.
- **Caller identity**: Displays the user email address if available (for [Webchat](/web-chat/introduction)), or phone number if applicable. Personally identifiable details are shown only to users with [PII-level access](/function/classes/conv-log#pii).
- **Environment and metadata**: Includes information such as [variant name](/variant-management/introduction), timezone, timestamp, [environment](/environments-and-versions/introduction) (e.g. Sandbox or Production), and version ID.
  Active calls display a **live duration indicator** beside the environment label.
- **Matched topics**: When topics from the knowledge base are referenced or triggered, they are shown as tags beneath the corresponding utterance.
- **Diagnosis panel**: Toggle to view system-level debugging tools and any structured [function logs](/function/classes/conv-log).
- **Category tagging**: Use the dropdown at the bottom of the screen to assign categories for reporting or follow-up.
- **Conversation status**: The end of the conversation is visually marked (e.g. “Ended conversation”). Live calls show an **“In progress”** badge until they close automatically.

## Key functionality

- **Browse and filter**: Navigate and filter through past or live conversations using metadata, time filters, duration, tags, or flows.
- **Monitor live calls**: Observe ongoing conversations in real time without affecting the call. Live visibility depends on your permission level.
- **Drill into specific calls**: View a complete transcript, inspect decision logic (if exposed), and assess how the agent handled the interaction.
- **Assign categories**: Manually label or tag calls for downstream use (e.g. QA review, escalation, training).
- **Export data**: Export transcripts and metadata for analysis, compliance, or reporting workflows.
