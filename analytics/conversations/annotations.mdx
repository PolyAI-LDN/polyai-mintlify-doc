From the **Conversation Review** page, users can annotate responses and identify areas for improvement:
- **Wrong transcription**: Marks ASR (automatic speech recognition) issues.
- **Missing topic**: Flags gaps in the agent's knowledge base.

You can share annotations with the PolyAI team to help us as part of our update and refinement process, or use insights from
this tab to improve your [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction).
