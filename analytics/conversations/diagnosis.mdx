The **Conversation Diagnosis** menu on the Conversation Review page provides deeper insights into the agent's behavior and decision-making at each turn.
Users can toggle different data layers to inspect how the agent understood the user and responded.

### Available diagnosis views

- **Function calls**
  View the [functions](/function/introduction) the agent triggered during the call.

- **Flows and steps**
  Tracks the agent's navigation through [flows](/flows/introduction) and steps, showing the execution path and decisions made.

- **Topic citations**
  Highlights the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) topics the agent used to generate each response.

- **Intents**
  Shows the recognized **intent** for the user's input (for intent-based projects).

- **Entities**
  Lists **extracted entities** captured from the user, like booking numbers, account IDs, or city names.
  This is especially useful in transactional scenarios where the agent needs to capture structured data from free text.
