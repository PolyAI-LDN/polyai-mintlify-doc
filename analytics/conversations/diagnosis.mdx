The **Conversation Diagnosis** menu on the Conversation Review page provides deeper insights into the agent's behavior and decision-making at each turn.
Users can toggle different data layers to inspect how the agent understood the user and responded.

- **Conversation variables**

- **Flows and steps**
  Tracks the agent's navigation through [flows](/flows/introduction) and steps, showing the execution path and decisions made.

- **Function calls**
  View the [functions](/function/introduction) the agent triggered during the call, including call parameters and outcomes.

- **Transcript corrections**
  Displays where the automatic transcript was edited for clarity or accuracy.

- **Turn latency**
  Measures how long the agent took to respond at each turn.

- **Interruptions**
  Shows when the caller interrupted the agent or when barge-in was detected.

- **Variants**
  Identifies which [variant](/variant-management/introduction) handled each part of the call.

- **Logs**
  Displays [function logs](/function/classes/conv-log) and any structured `conv.log` entries emitted during runtime.

- **Entities**
  Lists **extracted entities** captured from the user, like booking numbers, account IDs, or city names.
  This is especially useful in transactional scenarios where the agent needs to capture structured data from free text.
