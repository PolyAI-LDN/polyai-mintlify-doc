**Test Suite** lets builders save real conversations and re-run them to check whether the agent continues to behave as expected. It’s designed for teams working with generative AI, where responses may vary — making repeatable testing essential.

You can create **Test Cases** directly from the chat panel or Conversation review, then run them later against **Draft** or **Sandbox** versions. Group related cases into reusable **Test Sets** and re-run them in bulk whenever the agent changes.

## Concepts

- **Test Case**
  A single scenario captured from a real conversation (user messages, agent replies, and the [functions](/function/introduction) invoked). Each case tracks its **Last run** and **Outcome**.

- **Test Set**
  A named collection of Test Cases. Use sets to cover a feature area or release scope (for example, “Payments,” “Shipping,” “Core intents”). A Test Case can belong to **multiple** sets.

<Note>
Test Cases and Test Sets run against non-production versions. Select **Draft** or **Sandbox** when you start a run.

## Create a Test Case

<Steps>

<Step title="Save a test case from chat or Conversation review">

Click the **Create test** button (test-tube icon) in the chat panel or from a transcript in [Conversation review](/analytics/conversations/introduction).
Name the case and save it.

</Step>

<Step title="[Optional] Edit parameters">

A case stores the function values from the original interaction. Optionally adjust fields to explore a controlled variation of the same scenario.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Create a Test Set

- Go to **Manage → Test suite → Test Sets** and select **New set**.
- Give the set a **name** and add cases from the picker.
- A case can be added to more than one set (for example, both “Billing” and “Critical paths”).

> Tip: Create focused sets (“Refunds,” “Shipping address changes,” “Escalations”) so failures point straight to the right area.

## Run tests

You can run a **single case** or an entire **set**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single case">

  1. Open the case in **Test Cases**.
  2. Choose **Draft** or **Sandbox**.
  3. Select **Run** to execute just this scenario.

  The case shows **Outcome** and **Last run** after completion.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Test set">

  1. Open the set in **Test Sets** and select **Run set**.
  2. Choose **Draft** or **Sandbox**.
  3. Start the run to execute all member cases together.

  The set displays an aggregated view with pass/fail counts and trend charts so you can see whether the area is safe to ship.
