**Smart Analyst** is a conversational tool that uses AI to analyze a random sample of calls from the past day. It allows you to ask natural questions about agent usage, uncovering behavior patterns and surfacing performance insights.

This feature is currently in **open beta**. Contact your PolyAI representative to request access.

## Overview

Smart Analyst appears as a chatbot inside Studio. It reviews a sample of calls from the past 24 hours and provides instant answers to your questions. You can explore conversation data conversationally — without needing to write SQL or wait on a data team.

Example queries include:
- *How long are my calls on average?*
- *Which intents failed yesterday?*
- *What’s the most common escalation reason?*

## How it works

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the Smart Analyst page">
Navigate to **Smart Analyst** in the Studio sidebar. The interface opens with a chat window and a summary of the latest available data.
</Step>

<Step title="Ask a question">
Type a question into the chat. The system reviews call transcripts and metadata from the previous day’s calls to generate a response.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore further">
You can ask follow-up questions or change topics. Smart Analyst understands context and will continue the conversation based on what you’ve already asked.
</Step>

<Step title="Review insights">
Use Smart Analyst to uncover patterns, identify failure points, and track agent performance without writing queries.
