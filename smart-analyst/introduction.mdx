**Smart Analyst** is a conversational analytics tool that uses AI to review a sample of calls from the past 24 hours. It allows you to ask natural-language questions — like *“What are the top escalation reasons?”* — and get immediate answers, without writing queries or waiting for a data team.

This feature is currently in **open beta**. Contact your PolyAI representative to request access.

Smart Analyst appears as a chatbot inside Studio. It automatically analyzes recent calls and surfaces actionable insights — from agent usage to customer sentiment to conversation drop-off patterns.

### Key benefits:
- Ask **freeform questions** about real call data
- Identify **top containment blockers**
- Surface **technical issues, drop-offs, or sentiment trends**
- Track **daily agent performance and usage patterns**

## Example prompts

Smart Analyst understands natural questions across a range of categories:

### Containment & Transfer Insights
- *What are the top 5 reasons calls are transferred to a human agent?*
- *What % of reservations are dropped before confirmation?*
- *What are the most common reasons customers don’t complete a reservation?*
- *What actions could increase containment for loyalty lookup failures?*

### Quality & sentiment
- *Do customers express frustration with the assistant?*
- *What types of calls result in negative sentiment?*
- *Are customers complaining about pricing or offers?*
- *Are customers reporting issues with our mobile app or site?*

### Conversation analytics
- *What are my top 5 verb–noun pairings across “Speak To” conversations?*
- *Which calls had the longest AHT yesterday?*
- *Which intents failed the most often?*

### Knowledge gaps
- *What kinds of questions are we not handling well?*
- *What information does the assistant usually request during booking?*
- *How does the assistant handle unavailable dates?*

### Reservation-specific insights
- *What drives drop-offs in the reservation flow?*
- *What are the top blockers during reservation confirmation?*

## Templates

![smart-analyst-template](/images/release-notes/2510/analyst-template.png)

Smart Analyst includes a **Templates** interface that helps you start faster with ready-made, categorized prompts.

### How it works
- Choose from pre-built templates grouped by **Customer Insights**, **Agent Performance**, and **Custom Research**.
- Each template includes a clear description and an optimized query for instant insight generation.
- Selecting a template automatically populates the prompt field — simply run it or modify as needed.
- Templates are designed to help non-technical users discover insights quickly without knowing how to structure analytical queries.
- Template categories and examples will expand over time to support more use cases.
