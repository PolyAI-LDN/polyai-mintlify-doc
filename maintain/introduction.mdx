description: Make quick and easy changes to how your agent works
---

In the course of maintaining an active Agent Studio deployment, you might need to:

- [Edit knowledge base items or add new topics](./knowledge-base)
- [Change a phone number or SIP route](./routing-handoffs)
- [Check performance or listen to calls](./qa-analytics)
- [Bulk-update content with a CSV](/essentials/imports)
- [Troubleshoot something that broke](./common-issues)

<Tip> When in doubt, use your [environments](/environments-and-versions/introduction) carefully. Make the change in **Sandbox**, test it, then promote to **Production** once you are ready. </Tip>
