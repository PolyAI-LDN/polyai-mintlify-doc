title: Maintaining your agent
description: How to keep a live PolyAI agent accurate and healthy without touching code.
---

This guide is for anyone who **inherits** a PolyAI voice or chat agent after launch—operations managers, CX leads, marketing coordinators, or front-desk staff. You didn’t build the bot, but you’re now on the hook for keeping it useful and up to date.

Typical tasks you might need to perform:

- **Edit FAQs or add new topics** → see [Knowledge base](./knowledge-base)
- **Change a phone number or SIP route** → see [Routing and handoffs](./routing-handoffs)
- **Check performance or listen to calls** → see [QA and analytics](./qa-analytics)
- **Bulk-update content with a CSV** → see [CSV imports](/essentials/imports)
- **Troubleshoot something that broke** → see [Common issues](./common-issues)

This guide shows which changes are safe to do yourself, the exact steps, and when to escalate to PolyAI.

## What this guide covers

- Quick content tweaks: FAQs, greetings, disclaimers
- Routing and handoff adjustments
- Dashboards and conversation review
- CSV imports and exports
- Common fixes and escalation paths

## What this guide doesn’t cover

- Building new agents or flows
- Writing Python functions or integrations
- Deep telephony configuration, multi-environment DevOps

If your task feels like development, ping your implementation team or email **[platform-support@poly-ai.com](mailto:platform-support@poly-ai.com)**.

## Who it’s for

Non-technical users who just need to keep the bot running smoothly. No prior knowledge of Agent Studio is required.

<Tip> When in doubt, make the change in **Sandbox**, test it, then promote to **Production** once you’re happy. </Tip>
