# QA and analytics

After you update content or routing, you’ll want to check that the change actually helped. PolyAI gives you two main tools:

1. **Dashboards** – high-level metrics and trends
2. **Conversation review** – transcript-level inspection and tagging

This page shows the quickest way to use both.

## Pick the right dashboard

| Use case | Go here |
|----------|---------|
| Daily health check (calls, containment, AHT) | [Standard dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/standard) |
| Risk or policy compliance | [Safety dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/safety) |
| Anything bespoke (e.g. bookings, revenue) | [Custom dashboards](/analytics/dashboards/custom) – ask your CSM if you don’t see one |

Dashboards default to **Production** and **last 7 days**. Change the environment or date range at the top-right.

## Example workflow: did my FAQ edit improve containment?

1. Open the **Standard dashboard**.
2. Set the date range:
   - **From** = the day you promoted the change
   - **To** = today
3. Check **Containment rate**.
   - If it went up → good sign
   - If it dropped or stayed flat, drill down to conversations (next section)

## Review conversations

1. Go to **Analyze → Conversations → Review**.
2. Use filters:
   - **Date range** – same window you used in the dashboard
   - **Topic** – select the FAQ you edited
3. Click a call to open the transcript.
4. Check:
   - Did the agent serve the new answer?
   - Did the caller stay in self-service or ask for a human?
5. If something looks off, tag it.

### Tagging and annotations

At the bottom-right of a transcript:

- **Category** – pick a label like *Needs KB fix* or *Escalated unnecessarily*
- **Annotation** – flag *Wrong transcription* or *Missing topic*

These tags surface in QA reports and help PS/Product spot patterns.

## Export transcripts (optional)

Need raw data for deeper analysis?

1. In **Conversations**, select your filters.
2. Click **Export** → *CSV* or *JSON*.
3. You’ll get a download link with call metadata and the full transcripts.

See [Call data → Transcripts](/call-data/studio-transcripts) for field definitions.

## When to escalate

| Situation | Who to contact |
|-----------|----------------|
| Metrics flat after multiple tweaks | Your CSM – may need flow changes |
| Consistent ASR errors | PolyAI support – include call IDs |
| Dashboard missing a metric you need | Analytics team via your CSM |
| Safety dashboard shows spikes | Raise with PS immediately |

## Next steps

- Check the [standard dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/standard) now to make sure your latest edit had the intended effect.
- If you’re comfortable with bulk analysis, explore [assistant analysis](/assistant-analysis/introduction) for batched call scoring.
