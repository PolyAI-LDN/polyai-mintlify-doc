Most hiccups fall into a handful of patterns. Before you open a support ticket, run through the checks below.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix | Where to look |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **My edit isn't live** | You saved in *Sandbox* but didn't promote. | Promote the new version in **Environments & versions**. | [Environments & versions ↗](/environments-and-versions/introduction) |
| **The bot still uses the old answer** | Cached variant or conflicting topic. | 1) Clear your browser cache / soft-reload. 2) Check if another topic has similar sample questions and higher priority. | [Knowledge base ↗](./knowledge-base) |
| **Calls aren't transferring** | Wrong number format, SIP error, or firewall. | Confirm **Route** starts with `+` and country code. If SIP, double-check URI and headers. Test in *Sandbox* first. | [Routing and handoffs ↗](./routing-handoffs) |
| **Analytics show zero calls** | Dashboard filtered to the wrong environment or date. | Switch environment to **Production** and widen the date range. | [Dashboards overview ↗](/analytics/dashboards/introduction) |
| **CSV import failed** | Header names or file encoding off. | Re-export a fresh CSV, copy-paste rows, save as UTF-8, re-import. | [CSV imports ↗](/essentials/imports) |
| **I can't edit anything** | Read-only permissions. | Ask a project admin to grant you **Editor** in **User management**. | [Invite users ↗](/user-management/invite-users) |
| **Audio is silent or distorted** | Voice config mismatch or bad network. | Check **Voice → Config** for the correct TTS voice. Test your network or try another device. | [Voice config ↗](/voice/config) |
| **Agent answers a totally different question** | Mis-matched topic or ASR error. | Review the conversation, tag **Wrong transcription** or **Missing topic**, and fix accordingly. | [Conversation review ↗](/analytics/conversations/review) |

## When to escalate

Contact **[platform-support@poly-ai.com](mailto:platform-support@poly-ai.com)** if:

- You see repeated **4XX/5XX** errors in call logs.
- SIP handoffs fail and you've validated the number/URI.
- Dashboards or transcripts aren't loading at all.
