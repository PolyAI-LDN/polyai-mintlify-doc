description: How to add, edit, and bulk-manage FAQ content in a live PolyAI agent.
---

The **knowledge base (KB)** powers the agent’s FAQ answers. Small tweaks here can solve most “the bot said the wrong thing” issues. This page shows you the safest ways to:

- Edit an existing FAQ
- Add new questions and answers
- Re-order or archive topics
- Import or export content in bulk
- Promote changes to production

> Tip: Always test in *Sandbox* first and promote only when you’re happy. Details are in [Environments & versions](/environments-and-versions/introduction).

## Open the knowledge base

1. In the left sidebar, select **Knowledge base**.
2. Pick the environment you want to edit (default is **Sandbox**).
3. The topic list appears on the left, with sample questions and answers on the right.

## Edit an existing FAQ

1. Click the topic you want to change.
2. Update text directly in the *Answer* panel.
3. Press **Save** (or `Cmd/Ctrl + S`).
4. Use **Preview** to run a quick test before publishing.

Common fixes:

| Issue | What to do |
|-------|------------|
| The agent gives a partial answer | Add clarifying details to the *Answer* field. |
| It triggers the wrong topic | Add a few of the user’s actual phrasings as *Sample questions*. |
| It overlaps another topic | Merge the content or re-title one topic to be more specific. |

## Add a new topic

1. Click **New topic**.
2. Enter a clear title (e.g. “Parking fees”).
3. Add at least three *Sample questions*—think of real user wording.
4. Write the *Answer* in plain language.
5. Save and preview.

> Note: You can nest topics under section headers for large KBs, but shallow hierarchies are easier for the agent to search.

## Re-order or archive topics

- **Drag and drop** in the sidebar to move a topic higher or lower in priority.
- To hide a topic without deleting it, click **Archive**. Archived topics stay searchable for editors but won’t match user queries.

## Bulk edits with CSV

Large updates are faster in a spreadsheet.

1. Click **Export CSV** to download the current KB.
2. Edit or add rows in your spreadsheet app.
   - Keep column headers exactly as exported.
   - Leave IDs intact for topics you’re editing; new rows will create new topics.
3. Save as CSV.
4. Click **Import CSV** and upload the file.
5. Review the diff, then **Confirm import**.

See [CSV imports](/essentials/csv-imports) for file format details.

## Promote your changes

1. When tests look good, open **Environments & versions**.
2. Select the new *Sandbox* version.
3. Click **Promote to production**.
4. Confirm. The change is live within a minute.

## When to ask for help

Escalate to PolyAI support or your PS contact if you need to:

- Add Python functions or external API calls
- Localise a multi-language KB
- Migrate content between separate projects
- Undo a large import gone wrong

For anything else, you should now be able to self-serve.
