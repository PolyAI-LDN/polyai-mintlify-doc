<Note>Visit the [Conversation review](/analytics/conversations/review) feature page for more detailed information on using transcripts and live calls for analysis.</Note>

Use the PolyAI Agent Studio to access and review call transcripts and recordings directly. The Studio’s filtering tools allow precise searches for specific interactions, providing an efficient way to analyze conversations without coding.
Both **live** and **completed** calls are visible here — live calls stream in real time and update automatically.

For programmatic access to transcripts, refer to [List Conversations](/call-data/conversations-api/list-conversations).

## Accessing transcripts in the PolyAI Studio

To view conversation transcripts:

1. Go to the **Conversations** page in the PolyAI Studio.
2. Click **Filter conversations** and add filters based on your search criteria. Available filters include:

   * **Call handoff** – Identify conversations involving handoff events.
   * **Duration** – Filter calls by duration length.
   * **Function calls** – Search interactions where specific functions were invoked.
   * **Phone number** – Filter by the caller’s or recipient’s phone number.
   * **Safety flag** – Identify flagged conversations.
   * **Start date** – Set a date range for the search.
   * **Environment** – Filter by environment type, such as Sandbox or Production.

3. Select a conversation from the results to open its details, including transcript and audio playback.

When enabled, **PolyScore** appears at the top of certain transcripts and provides an automatic quality rating for the conversation.
Scores are normalized across agents and environments, based on clarity, escalation handling, and resolution quality.
Use PolyScore to quickly identify strong and weak calls for review, coaching, or reporting.
