The **List Conversations** feature is central to PolyAI's data synchronization framework. It enables you to retrieve structured lists
of conversation transcripts, complete with metadata, timestamps, and states.

For technical details and API specifications, refer to the [Get Conversation API documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversation).

## Push and pull

PolyAI supports both **push** and **pull API** models, offering flexible synchronization options:

* **Pull API**: On-demand metadata retrieval through the List Conversations endpoint. Ideal for periodic data collection or workflows where updates are less time-sensitive.

* **Push API**: Automatically sends updates (new conversations or completed interactions) to your system in real time. Best suited for dashboards requiring prompt updates.

<Note>For triggering **instant** communication updates for real-time use cases, like determining where to route a call, it
is recommended to use [handoff states](handoff-states).</Note>

### Best practices

1. **Pull**: Use this model for scheduled reporting or when real-time updates are unnecessary.

2. **Push**: Leverage push updates for real-time synchronization in dynamic environments, such as live agent dashboards.

3. Assess your system's requirements to determine whether a push or pull model best aligns with your workflow and data processing needs.

## Integration with other workflows

The **List Conversations API** can fit into a larger data-sharing workflow:

1. [Manual access using the platform](../platform-transcripts): View richly-detailed conversation transcripts and recordings directly in the PolyAI platform.

2. **End of call metadata retrieval**: Automate metadata syncing after conversations using push or pull APIs.

3. [**Handoff metadata integration**](handoff-states): Provide your live customer agent with a quick identifier indicating what kind of call they have just received.
