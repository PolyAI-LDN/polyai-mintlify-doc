Welcome to the Voice section of the PolyAI Agent Studio, where you can harness the power of cutting-edge voice technology to enhance your
customer interactions. At PolyAI, we pride ourselves on being at the forefront of the industry, delivering superhuman-like voice
 agents that redefine the customer experience.

## Why voice matters

Voice is a fundamental aspect of human communication, and it plays a pivotal role in shaping the perception of your brand. With
PolyAI's proprietary technology, you can ensure that your voice agent embodies the essence of your business image or use case,
 delivering seamless and natural interaction with your customers.

## Voice configuration

In the **Voice configuration** tab, you can tailor the voice of your agent to match your preferences and requirements. Choose
 from a selection of voices and adjust parameters such as stability, clarity, and similarity to create a voice that aligns perfectly
  with your brand identity.

## Choosing the right voice

Selecting the right voice for your agent is crucial in creating an authentic and engaging experience for your customers. Whether
 you're aiming for professionalism, friendliness, or sophistication, PolyAI's technology enables you to find the perfect match for
 your business image or use case.

## [Custom voice request](./custom-voice-request)

For enterprise clients seeking a truly bespoke solution, our **Custom voice request** service offers the opportunity to create a
custom voice tailored to your specific needs. Leveraging our in-house voice cloning technology, we can develop a unique voice that
embodies the personality and characteristics of your brand.

## [Multi-voice](./multi-voice)

You can assign multiple voices to a single agent. Since each voice has
distinct qualities, this setup can simulate a full team of agents handling conversations. You can configure this in any function,
offering increased realism and flexibility, allowing your voice agents to deliver richer and more engaging repeat interactions.
