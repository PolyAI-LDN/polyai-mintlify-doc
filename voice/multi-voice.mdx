Multi-voice allows you to assign multiple voices to an agent. Since each voice has distinct qualities, this setup can simulate a full team of agents handling conversations.

You can configure multi-voice using Python logic or the **Agent voice** tab:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Using the Agent voice tab">
Click **New voice** to add additional voices to your agent. You can select from the available languages, genders, and styles or [add a new voice](/voice/add-a-new-voice).

Once added, all voices will appear in the list and can be configured independently.

</Tab>

<Tab title="B">
**Customize individual voice settings**

For each voice, you can fine-tune the advanced settings:

- **Stability (%):** Control how consistent the voice sounds across generations.
- **Clarity and Similarity (%):** Balance naturalness and similarity to the target voice.

</Tab>

<Tab title="C">
**Adjust voice weights**

After adding multiple voices, use the weight sliders to define how frequently each voice is selected during conversations. All weights must add up to 100%.

For example:
- 80% main voice
- 10% each for two alternates

You can configure this in any function, though this guide assumes you're using the [start function](/function/start-function).

To use multiple voices, you need their voice IDs from your chosen TTS provider. Refer to the [function TTS provider configuration](/function/classes) for full details on supported providers and their configuration options.

Here is an example of how to configure multiple voices, where the agent is randomly assigned a voice at the start of each interaction:

```python
def start_function(conv: Conversation):
    conv.randomize_voice([
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=ElevenLabsVoice(
                voice_id="LcfCDJNUPlGQjkzn1xUU",
                similarity_boost=0.2,
                stability=0.4
            ),
            weight=0.5
        ),
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=RimeVoice(
                provider_voice_id="s3://path-to-manifest.json",
                style="neutral"
            ),
            weight=0.5
        )
    ])
```

- `conv.randomize_voice([...])`: Selects a voice at random based on the assigned weights.
- `VoiceWeighting`: Associates a voice with a probability of being selected.
- **Weights** define selection probability:
  - The sum of all weights must equal 1.0.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding voice weights

You can add a maximum of **five voices** to an AI agent.

The `weight` parameter determines how often each voice is selected. The sum of all weights must equal **1.0**.

Examples:
- One voice at `1.0`: Always uses that voice.
- Two voices at `0.5` each: Each is selected 50% of the time.
- Four voices at `0.25` each.

## Personalizing repeat caller experiences

Repeat callers are more likely to ask for a human agent if they hear the same AI voice every time. Switching voices on subsequent calls can make interactions feel less robotic, and it is proven to reduce immediate escalations.

Using multi-voice may prevent callers from instantly requesting an agent just because they recognize the AI.
