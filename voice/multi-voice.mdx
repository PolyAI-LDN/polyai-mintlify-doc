Multi-voice allows you to assign multiple voices to an agent. Since each voice has distinct qualities, this setup can simulate a full team of agents handling conversations. You can configure this in any function, though this guide assumes you're using the [start function](/function/start-function). 

<Note>You can configure multi-voice both using Python logic, and through the Agent Studio UI.</Note>

## Select your voices

To use multiple voices, you need their voice IDs from your chosen TTS provider. Refer to the [function TTS provider configuration](/function/classes) for full details on supported providers and their configuration options.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure multiple voices, where the agent is randomly assigned a voice at the start of each interaction:

```python
def start_function(conv: Conversation):
    conv.randomize_voice([
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=ElevenLabsVoice(
                voice_id="LcfCDJNUPlGQjkzn1xUU",
                similarity_boost=0.2,
                stability=0.4
            ),
            weight=0.5
        ),
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=RimeVoice(
                provider_voice_id="s3://path-to-manifest.json",
                style="neutral"
            ),
            weight=0.5
        )
    ])
```

### How it works

- `conv.randomize_voice([...])`: Selects a voice at random based on the assigned weights.
- `VoiceWeighting`: Associates a voice with a probability of being selected.
- **Weights** define selection probability:
  - The sum of all weights must equal 1.0.

## Understanding voice weights

You can add a maximum of **five voices** to an AI agent.

The `weight` parameter determines how often each voice is selected. The sum of all weights must equal **1.0**.

Examples:
- One voice at `1.0`: Always uses that voice.
- Two voices at `0.5` each: Each is selected 50% of the time.
- Four voices at `0.25` each.

## Personalizing repeat caller experiences

Repeat callers are more likely to ask for a human agent if they hear the same AI voice every time. Switching voices on subsequent calls can make interactions feel less robotic, and it is proven to reduce immediate escalations.

Using multi-voice may prevent callers from instantly requesting an agent just because they recognize the AI.
