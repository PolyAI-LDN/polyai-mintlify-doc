The **Voice** tab in Agent Studio allows you to configure the voice settings for your agent. You can select, preview, and adjust voices to create the best possible interaction experience for your users. You can also customize the disclaimer voice separately.

  - Next to the **Change** button, click the **Settings** icon <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to fine-tune the selected voice.
  - In the Voice Settings popup:
       - **Stability** controls how consistent the voice sounds over time. A higher setting keeps the tone and delivery more uniform across different responses.
	   - **Clarity and Similarity** adjusts how closely the generated voice matches the original recorded voice. A higher setting sounds more realistic and detailed, but can sometimes be less resilient to unexpected prompts. A lower setting smooths the voice slightly, making it better suited for dynamic or ASR-driven content.

  Adjust the sliders according to your preferences and click **Done** to save changes.
