**Agent Analysis** uses an LLM to analyze and categorize calls based on a configurable prompt and list of categories. You can use it to generate quick, repeatable analysis of conversation quality and outcomes across groups of up to **250** calls.

## Overview

Each agent can have one active analysis configuration. Once this is set up, batches of up to 250 calls can be grouped and processed, returning one category per call. Results are displayed in a visual breakdown and can be reviewed or adjusted manually.

### Key capabilities
- Categorize calls using a custom LLM prompt and defined categories
- Visualize category distribution across recent call groups
- Edit or reassign categories directly from the analysis view
- Automate analyses to run on a recurring schedule

## How it works

<Steps>

<Step title="Create or edit your analysis configuration">
![assistant-analysis-config](/images/analysis-config.png)
Go to **Agent Analysis** and open **Analysis configuration**. The configuration includes:
- A **Prompt** describing the task, e.g. *“You are a call center manager assessing agent performance.”*
- A **Question** to guide the LLM's judgment, e.g. *“Was this call handled successfully?”*
- A set of **Categories** — each with a name, description, and color
</Step>

<Step title="Group calls for analysis">
Click **Create group**. This opens the [Conversations](/analytics/conversations/introduction) view, where calls can be filtered and selected.
</Step>

<Step title="View results">
Once the group is created, it appears on the **Agent Analysis** page. Each group shows a visual breakdown of categories and a list of processed calls.

Click **Open** to review individual calls and access [transcripts](/call-data/studio-transcripts) and metadata.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit if needed">
Category assignments can be edited manually. These changes persist unless the call is reprocessed in a new batch.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Scheduled batches

![scheduled-batches](/images/release-notes/2510/scheduled-batches.png)

Agent Analysis can now run automatically on a **daily or weekly schedule**, helping you track category trends over time.

### How it works
- Set up an **automated schedule** from the Agent Analysis dashboard.
- Choose **daily** or **weekly** runs to continuously analyze the latest call data.
- Each batch appears as a new entry, with trend visualization across multiple runs.
- Review progress using **bar charts and filters** that compare results from up to 15 recent batches.
- Great for tracking long-term performance, consistency, or training outcomes.
