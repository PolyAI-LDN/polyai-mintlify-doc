PolyAI releases **monthly** platform updates, which are versioned using the following syntax:

| Segment    | Meaning                                   | Example               |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **24**     | The release year, indicating the calendar year of the update. | *2024*                |
| **4**      | The quarter of the year when the release occurred. | *Q4 (October–December)* |
| **1**      | The specific release within that quarter, showcasing the sequence. | *First update of Q4*  |

So version 24.4.1 is the **first** release of the **fourth** quarter in **2024**.
