<Accordion title="View knowledge base differences between versions" icon="book-open">
You can now use the [Environments & versions](/environments-and-versions/diffs) tab to compare two [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) versions
side-by-side and track modifications across the **sandbox, pre-release, and live** environments.

Versions are displayed as **split diffs**.

- **<Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Additions** appear as highlighted insertions.
- **<Icon icon="minus" iconType="solid" color="#D64F4F" /> Deletions** are marked for easy identification.
- **<Icon icon="rotate" iconType="solid" color="#3B73D1" /> Edits** are displayed with side-by-side text differences.

- Quickly identify additions, deletions, and changes between knowledge base versions.
- Easily attribute changes to their authors.

Visit the [Environments & versions](/environments-and-versions/diffs) page for more details.

<Accordion title="Manage function latency" icon="wifi">
Improve the experience for users when a function takes longer than expected by playing filler utterances during the delay.

![latency-control](/images/release-notes/2512/latency-control.png)

**How it works:**
- Set up **delay responses** that play while a function is still processing.
- Define the **initial delay** before the first filler utterance is played.
- Configure the **interval** between utterances to control pacing.
- Specify the **expected length** of each utterance for smoother timing.

This feature ensures that users receive real-time feedback instead of silence, making interactions feel more natural. Itâ€™s useful for scenarios like **booking confirmations** or **data lookups**, where a response takes a few seconds.

Visit the [Function delay control](/function/delay-control) page for more details.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Upload audio to replace cached items" icon="volume-high">
Upload pre-recorded audio directly from the **audio management resource** in Jupiter.

![audio-upload](/images/release-notes/2512/audio-upload.png)

**Key benefits:**
- Easily replace TTS with high-quality voice actor recordings.
- Improve voice consistency across different assistant responses.
- Initial release supports single file uploads, with bulk upload functionality coming soon.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reference variants in the knowledge base" icon="layer-group">
Reference variant attributes dynamically within knowledge base responses.

![variants](/images/release-notes/2512/variants.png)

**How it works:**
- Add variant attributes by typing `/` or selecting the `+` icon in content fields.
- Reference existing attributes or create new ones dynamically.
- Personalize responses by encoding structured variant data.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing transition functions in a flow" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
Transition functions are now managed centrally within the flow editor.

![transition-functions](/images/release-notes/2512/transition-functions.png)

**Key benefits:**
- Prevents accidental deletions when modifying flows.
- Enables reusing, duplicating, and managing transition functions from a single interface.
- Streamlines assistant configuration and debugging.

Visit the [flows](/flows/introduction) page for more details.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Conversation review annotations" icon="magnifying-glass">
Users can now annotate user conversation turns for:

 - **Missed topics**
 - **Incorrect ASR transcriptions**

Agent conversation turns can be annotated for **wrong information**.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handoff SIP configuration" icon="phone">
You can now configure handoff using SIP, with [INVITE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-13.3.1), [REFER](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3515.txt), or [BYE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3261.html).
You can also add [SIP headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml) to the handoff template.

![sip-handoff](/images/release-notes/2512/handoff-sip.png)

**How it works:**
- The default handoff method is set to REFER.
- You can adjust this to other methods according to the specific needs of your projects.
- You can add SIP headers to the handoff.

Visit the [call handoff](/knowledge-base/introduction) page for more details.

![enterprise-dashboard](/images/release-notes/2512/new-dashboard.png)

**Key benefits:**
- Monitor total calls, call duration, words generated, and key metrics.
- Improve oversight of agent performance and containment rates.
- Can be configured to work alongside custom dashboards for deeper analytics.
