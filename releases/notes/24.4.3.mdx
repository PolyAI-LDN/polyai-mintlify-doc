<Tip> Visit the full [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) page for details. </Tip>

![variants](/images/release-notes/variant-management.png)

Use variants to manage [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) content for multiple locations in a single assistant, and use one assistant to handle
enquiries about a business with outlets in different timezones, legal jurisdictions, or tax codes.

Each variant has content for custom attributes like phone numbers, addresses, and opening hours. You can use variants and variables in [SMS](/sms/introduction),
[functions](/functions/introduction), and [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) entries, with the `${variant_foo}` format:

> Imagine you have an attribute `site_number`, your SMS content field would be:
> `Please contact the office at ${variant_site_number}`

<Tip>You can add logic to your [start function](/function/start-function) to direct the assistant to likely variant knowledge base items
based on phone number geolocation.</Tip>
