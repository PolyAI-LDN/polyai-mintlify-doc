The December 2024 release focuses on improving multi-site configurations, refining ASR capabilities, and offering enhanced flexibility in managing TTS audio. These features aim to optimize the Platform's functionality for builders and end-users alike.

## Multi-site config

**Description**:
Manage Knowledge Base (KB) content for multiple locations within a single assistant. Tailor responses for different sites (e.g., New York, London, Tokyo) with specific variants for each location.

**Key features**:
- Define attributes like phone numbers, addresses, and opening hours for each site.
- Configure variants directly in the "Variant Management" tab.
- Use variants and variables in SMS messages with the `${variant_foo}` format.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the "Variant Management" tab under Build. Add or edit variants and attributes in the provided table. Configure routing in the start function to direct callers based on phone numbers.

## ASR updates

**Description**:
Builders can now refine Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs with custom string corrections, ensuring better accuracy for LLM inputs.

**Use cases**:
- Correct domain-specific terms (e.g., "ICU" instead of "I see you").
- Improve accuracy in fields like medical transcription.

**How to use**:
Go to "Speech Recognition" > "Transcript Corrections." Add regular expressions and associated replacements to the corrections list.

**Description**:
Bias ASR results to prioritize specific keywords and phrases, improving recognition for domain-specific terms.

**Key features**:
- Boost keywords such as "book," "room," and "concierge" for hospitality use cases.
- Adjust biasing strength through a slider for optimal accuracy.

**How to use**:
Go to "Speech Recognition" > "Keyphrase Boosting." Add keywords and adjust bias strength as needed.

## Audio management

**Description**:
Manage cached TTS audio directly within the Platform. Builders can now browse, delete, regenerate, or upload cached audio files.

**Key benefits**:
- Maintain high audio quality with on-demand regeneration.
- Simplify audio management workflows for voice assistants.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the "Audio Cache" section under Build. Select audio files to delete or regenerate, or upload new audio files.

## Customize latency response delay

**Description**:
Control the response delay for the assistant to better match conversational tone or audience preferences.

**Use cases**:
- Configure thoughtful delays to prevent interruptions.
- Set faster response times for rapid user queries.

**How to use**:
Go to "Settings" and select the desired response delay time. Adjust the tone based on the intended audience and demographic.

## Copy/paste flows

**Description**:
Easily copy and paste flows or specific nodes between projects, streamlining builds and enabling faster configurations.

**Key features**:
- Copy entire flows or partial nodes within or across projects.
- Global and transition functions are imported without overwriting existing templates.

**How to use**:
Use `Cmd/Ctrl + C` to copy and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` to paste flows or nodes. Access this feature from the flow editor in the Build section.

## Call recordings download

**Description**:
Users can now download call recordings directly from the Platform for offline review and analysis.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the conversation detail page. Click on the “Download” icon to save the call recordings locally. Ensure "Call Download" permissions are enabled for your account.
