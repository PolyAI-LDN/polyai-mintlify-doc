**What's new:**
- You can use a conversation to create a **Test Case** against a single scenario.
- These are run directly from the **Test Cases tab**, after selecting the agent version (Draft/Sandbox) to test against.
- Outcomes and last-run timestamps are tracked automatically.
- Organize cases into **Test Sets** to rerun whole groups at once and view aggregated results with charts.
- Cases can belong to **multiple sets**, so you can target them by feature or however else is required.
