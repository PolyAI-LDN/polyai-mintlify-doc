<Accordion title="Conversations API: tool calls" icon="brackets-curly" id="conversations-api-tool-calls">

Third-party QA tools and internal test rigs can now read **tool/function call events** from the Conversations API.  

**What's new:**
- Every function call made during a conversation is now surfaced in the API response  
- Makes it possible to verify not just the dialogue, but also the actions taken behind the scenes  
- Access is scoped per environment (Sandbox, Pre-release, Live) so external tools donâ€™t touch production data
