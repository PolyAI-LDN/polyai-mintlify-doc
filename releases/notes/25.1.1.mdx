## In-app calling

In-app calling is a new way test your assistants without the need to provision a number or involve telephony services. With the new in-browser
calling feature, you can now test your assistant’s voice capabilities directly in the Platform interface, so you can setup testing quickly and simply
and iterate quickly in your testing workflow.

**How to use**:
In any project, start an in-app call by navigating to the interaction testing section. Grant microphone access to your browser to
initiate a conversation.

## Audio management

Now, you can edit your TTS audio cache directly in the Platform Easily delete audio from the cache or regenerate it to bias
towards the highest quality.

Builders can now manage TTS audio cache directly in the platform, allowing them to delete or regenerate cached audio as needed. This
ensures the highest-quality audio is always used.

**Key benefits**:
- Improved control over cached audio files.
- Enhanced audio quality with on-demand regeneration.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the "Audio Cache" section under the Build tab. Select the audio files to delete or regenerate.

## End-of-conversation functions

Builders can now trigger an unconditional Function Call at the conclusion of every conversation. This capability allows seamless
integration.

Trigger an automatic function call at the end of every conversation, ensuring seamless integration with external systems. This capability
 is ideal for data logging, task automation, or sharing insights.

**Use cases**:
- **Data logging**: Automatically save conversation details to a CRM or database.
- **Task automation**: Trigger workflows like creating support tickets based on conversation context.
- **Insight sharing**: Generate call summaries for internal teams.

**How to use**:
Set up the end-of-conversation function on the "Functions" page under the Build section.

## Knowledge Base enhancements

### Navigation

Quickly navigate to the Knowledge Base from the Conversation Review page by simply clicking on the Matched Topic. This enhancement reduces
the time spent searching for topics manually, allowing you to review context relevant to the assistant’s response and make necessary adjustments.

We are also adding a tooltip for 'Matched Topics' to clarify their meaning and removing the 'Cited Topic' feature to avoid confusion about
each term. This change will help customers better understand the feature on their own, thereby reducing the amount of explanation our PSMs
need to provide.

Quickly navigate to matched topics from the conversation review page. Builders can easily access and edit topics related to specific interactions.

**Key updates**:
- Matched topics now include direct links to the Knowledge Base.
- A tooltip has been added to clarify the purpose of matched topics.

**How to use**:
In the conversation review interface, click on a matched topic to jump directly to the corresponding Knowledge Base entry.

### Structure

Builders can now place the sample questions in a distinct section separate from the content. This way, builders won't have to combine
questions and content within the same input box, enhancing clarity and organization.

Sample questions and content can now be separated within Knowledge Base topics, improving clarity and organization.

**Key benefits**:
- Distinction between questions and content for better readability.
- Simplified editing process for builders.

**How to use**:
In the Knowledge Base editor, add sample questions to the dedicated section under each topic.

## Share projects across workspaces

Builders can now effortlessly share projects across different workspaces. By exporting a project from one workspace and importing it into
 another, users can enhance sample projects without the need to start from scratch. This functionality also allows for testing on existing
 projects without risking any disruptions to production bots.

To export a project, users must have read/edit permissions (all permissions will be verified), while users with admin permissions can import
projects into the workspace.

Please note that there are a few elements that will not be imported:

- Secrets used in functions within the projects will not be transferred.
- SMS templates will be imported, but they will only be visible to users once the Twilio connection is established. Until Twilio is set up,
users will not be able to view any SMS templates.
- Existing conversations will not be imported.

Export and import projects between workspaces, enabling reuse and collaboration without disrupting production bots.

**Key features**:
- **Export**: Save projects from one workspace for use in another.
- **Import**: Bring exported projects into a new workspace.

**Considerations**:
- Secrets used in functions will not transfer.
- SMS templates require Twilio setup to become visible.
- Existing conversations are excluded from imports.

**How to use**:
Go to the project settings page to export or import projects.

## Conversations API variants
Variant information for each conversation on the Platform is now being stored and returned on the Conversations API to further enhance the Variant feature.

Variant information for each conversation is now stored and accessible via the Conversations API. This provides greater visibility into how variants impact interactions.

**Key benefits**:
- Improved reporting on variant usage.
- Enhanced ability to analyze conversation outcomes.

**How to use**:
Use the updated Conversations API endpoint to retrieve variant details for a specific conversation.

## Safety dashboard

The new enterprise safety dashboard is now available in the Platform for all projects. This showcases the number of flagged calls, as well
as which safety filter was triggered by any flagged call.

## Custom dashboards
Support for custom dashboards for all projects are now available in the Platform.  The “Overview” & “Enterprise Safety” page can also be
disabled for projects where only custom dashboards are needed to represent success metrics for a given project.the

Support for custom dashboards is now available for all projects. Builders can disable the default overview and safety dashboards and focus
solely on their own custom metrics.

**Key benefits**:
- Tailored dashboards to align with project-specific goals.
- Improved clarity and focus on critical success metrics.

**How to use**:
Access the dashboard settings page under the Analytics tab to configure custom dashboards.
