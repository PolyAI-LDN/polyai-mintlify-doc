The **January 2025** PolyAI platform release introduces easier in-browser calling, a new security dashboard, custom analytics
dashboards, a new knowledge base structure, and enhancements to functions, flows, and the Conversation API.

## In-app calling

In-app calling is a new, quicker way to [test voiced conversations](/get-started/assistant-chat) with your assistant. It means you
can test without [provisioning a number](/telephony/how-to-buy-number) or involving telephony services like [Twilio](/telephony/twilio/introduction).

In any project, click the phone icon <Icon icon="phone" size={24} /> in the top-right corner of a platform page to begin testing in-browser. You can select an [assistant
version](/environments-and-versions/introduction) on the dropdown.

## Audio management

<Tip>Visit the full [audio management](/audio-management/introduction) page for details on this new platform feature.</Tip>

You now have access to a text-to-speech audio cache, which will detect common phrases used by your assistants across multiple calls. These common utterances can then be
edited and tested until the quality of the voice meets your requirements.

## Knowledge base structure

Because it is often useful to guide the assistant by including sample questions in knowledge base entries, a distinct **Questions** field has been added
to the knowledge base UI.

Sample questions and content can now be separated within knowledge base topics, improving clarity and organization.

**Key benefits**:
- Distinction between questions and content for better readability.
- Simplified editing process for builders.

**How to use**:
In the knowledge base editor, add sample questions to the dedicated section under each topic.

## Safety dashboard

The new enterprise safety dashboard is now available in the Platform for all projects. This showcases the number of flagged calls, as well
as which safety filter was triggered by any flagged call.

## Custom dashboards

Support for custom dashboards for all projects are now available in the Platform.  The “Overview” & “Enterprise Safety” page can also be
disabled for projects where only custom dashboards are needed to represent success metrics for a given project.the

Support for custom dashboards is now available for all projects. Builders can disable the default overview and safety dashboards and focus
solely on their own custom metrics.

**Key benefits**:
- Tailored dashboards to align with project-specific goals.
- Improved clarity and focus on critical success metrics.

**How to use**:
Access the dashboard settings page under the Analytics tab to configure custom dashboards.

## End functions

<Tip>Visit the full [end function](/function/end-function) page for details on this new platform feature.</Tip>

![end-functions](/images/release-notes/end-functions.png)

You can now trigger an unconditional function call to conclude every conversation.

**Use cases**:
- **Data logging**: Save conversation details to a [CRM](/integrations/introduction) or [database](/call-data/introduction).
- **Task automation**: Trigger support workflows or send follow up [SMS](/sms/introduction) messages.

## Conversation review navigation

Quickly navigate to the knowledge base from the conversation review page by clicking on any matched topic.

## Import and export projects

Builders can now share projects across workspaces with export and import.

Assistants will be exported as a low-weight [binary](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-little-diddy-about-binary-file-formats/?utm_source=chatgpt.com )file.

<Tip> [Permissions](/user-management/access-control-scope): To export a project, a user must have read and edit permissions. Only [admin](/user-management/access-control-scope#admin-role) users can import
projects. </Tip>

A few elements that will not be imported:

- [Secrets](/secrets/introduction) will not be transferred.
- [SMS templates](/sms/introduction) will be imported, but they will only be visible to users once the [Twilio connection](/sms/introduction#connect-your-twilio-account) is established. Until
Twilio is set up, users will not be able to view any SMS templates.
- Any existing [analytics](analytics/dashboards/introduction) or [conversations](/analytics/conversations/review) data will not be imported.

## Variants in the Conversations API

Following the introduction of the [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) feature, both `variant_id` and `variant_name` are now included as request and response parameters for the following endpoints:

- [Get Conversations](/api-reference/conversations/endpoint/get-conversation) - `/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`
- [Get Maximum Concurrent Conversations](/api-reference/conversations/endpoint/get-max-concurrent)- `/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations/concurrency`
