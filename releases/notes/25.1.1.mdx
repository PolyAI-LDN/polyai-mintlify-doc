The January 2025 release introduces several enhancements and features designed to improve workflow efficiency, testing flexibility, and overall platform usability.

## In-app calling

**Key benefits**:
- Simplified setup for testing voice functionality.
- Instant testing capabilities, reducing time-to-insight.
- Enhanced workflow efficiency and demo quality.

**How to use**:
In any project, start an in-app call by navigating to the interaction testing section. Grant microphone access to your browser to initiate a conversation.

## Audio management

**Description**:
Builders can now manage TTS audio cache directly in the platform, allowing them to delete or regenerate cached audio as needed. This ensures the highest-quality audio is always used.

**Key benefits**:
- Improved control over cached audio files.
- Enhanced audio quality with on-demand regeneration.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the "Audio Cache" section under the Build tab. Select the audio files to delete or regenerate.

## End-of-conversation functions

**Description**:
Trigger an automatic function call at the end of every conversation, ensuring seamless integration with external systems. This capability is ideal for data logging, task automation, or sharing insights.

**Use cases**:
- **Data logging**: Automatically save conversation details to a CRM or database.
- **Task automation**: Trigger workflows like creating support tickets based on conversation context.
- **Insight sharing**: Generate call summaries for internal teams.

**How to use**:
Set up the end-of-conversation function on the "Functions" page under the Build section.

## Knowledge Base

## Custom dashboards

**Description**:
Support for custom dashboards is now available for all projects. Builders can disable default overview and safety dashboards to focus solely on custom metrics.
