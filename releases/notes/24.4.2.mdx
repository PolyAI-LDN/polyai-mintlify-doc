The November 2024 release brings significant improvements to SMS capabilities, debugging tools, and knowledge base export functionality, alongside enhancements for barge-in and dialogue management.

## Enhanced SMS functionality

**Description**:
The Platform now supports sending SMS messages to alternative numbers specified by callers. Builders can also upgrade SMS templates to advanced, customizable functions to support complex use cases.

**Key highlights**:
- **Alternative SMS number**: Collect alternative phone numbers from callers for SMS delivery.
- **Upgradable SMS functions**: Add custom logic to basic SMS templates for advanced configurations.

**How to use**:
Navigate to the SMS setup section under the Build tab. Use the assistantâ€™s flow editor to configure alternative number collection or upgrade templates as needed.

## In-app function debugging

**Description**:
View and copy real-time input, output, and error messages for Function Calls directly within the Conversation Review and Assistant Chat Panel.

**Key benefits**:
- Simplifies debugging during testing phases.
- Provides higher confidence in function performance.

**How to use**:
Open a conversation in the review interface. Inspect Function Calls and expand their details for debugging information.

## Knowledge base export functionality

**Description**:
Export Knowledge base topics to a CSV file directly from the Platform, making it easier to reuse, manage, or version control content.

**Key highlights**:
- **Available environments**: Draft and Sandbox only.
- **File naming convention**: `{Assistant Name}_{Env}_{Timestamp}_{version code}_KB.csv`.
    - Draft exports exclude version codes.
    - Timestamps reflect export time for easy tracking.

**How to use**:
Go to the Knowledge Base section in the Platform, select Export, and follow the prompts.

## Barge-in feature

**Description**:
Allow callers to interrupt assistants for natural conversational flow. This feature also shortens Voice Activation Detection (VAD) time and reduces latency.

**Key benefits**:
- Supports natural, human-like interactions.
- Improves latency and response times.

**How to use**:
Enable barge-in under the Response Controls section of the Build tab. Adjust sensitivity settings based on the use case.

## Stop keywords for dialogue management

**Description**:
Stop keywords give builders control over dialogue flow by halting assistant responses upon detecting specific words or phrases. These can trigger custom functions or prevent unwanted interactions.

**Key highlights**:
- Configure stop keywords using RegEx patterns.
- Tailor dialogue responses to client-specific needs.

**How to use**:
Navigate to Response Controls in the Build tab. Add stop keywords and configure associated function triggers.
