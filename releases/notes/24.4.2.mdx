<Accordion title="Stop on keyword" icon="ban">

Stop keywords give builders control over dialogue flow by halting assistant responses upon detecting specific words or phrases. These can
trigger custom functions or prevent unwanted interactions. Use this feature to configure stop keywords using **RegEx patterns.**

**Key highlights:**
- **Halt responses:** Interrupt the assistant's response when certain words or phrases (configured via RegEx) are detected in user input.
- **Trigger functions:** Use Stop Keywords to activate specific functions or workflows.

**How to use:**
1. Create a function
1. Navigate to **Response Controls** in the Build tab.
2. Add Stop Keywords and define their behavior using RegEx patterns.
3. Optionally, configure the assistant to trigger a custom function or workflow when a Stop Keyword is detected.
