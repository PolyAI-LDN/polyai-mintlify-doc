Nebula now integrates with **AWS QuickSight**, enabling embedded business intelligence and dashboard analytics directly in Agent Studio.

**What you can do:**

- Connect QuickSight dashboards via **ID** or **URL**
- Assign custom **slugs** and preview embedded dashboards before publishing
- **Create**, **rename**, **reorder**, and **delete** dashboards from a central settings page
- Access all settings from the new **Analytics Settings** screen

This marks the first stage in our migration from Luzmo to AWS QuickSight as our default BI provider—bringing improved performance, greater flexibility, and stronger long-term support for enterprise-grade analytics.

<Tip>Support for dataset configuration, embedded filters, and dashboard theming is planned for future releases.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Rich text refactor" icon="pen-to-square">

The rich text input has been rebuilt using **Lexical**, resolving multiple long-standing usability bugs and paving the way for future enhancements.

**Key improvements:**

- Fixed contentEditable glitches that previously required a trailing space
- You can now **search by top-level menu item names**, like “SMS” or “Handoff”
- The **Escape key** now closes popups more intuitively
- Fixed visual glitch showing **two input cursors** when the command popup is open
- Removed extra whitespace and resolved cases where **lines couldn’t be deleted**
- First result in command menus is now **auto-highlighted** for quicker selection
- Smoother handling of empty tags, broken references, and embedded content

**New functionality:**

- Open the insert menu by typing `/` or clicking the **plus icon**
- Supports structured flows, knowledge triggers, and action tags
- Maintains support for `{{mention}}` formatting
- Improved cursor and editing behavior throughout

<Tip>This refactor brings the editor experience closer to modern tools like Notion or Slack, making it faster and more intuitive for authors.</Tip>

**What's new:**

- New voice input form for Amazon Polly
- Auto-populates key voice metadata such as **language**, **accent**, and **gender**
- Lets you specify **attribute tags** to organise and filter available voices
- Simpler, cleaner config cards—without clutter from unused options like stability or clarity

<Tip>This update enables faster onboarding of new voice providers and a more scalable voice configuration model.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Smart Analyst v2" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">

Smart Analyst has been upgraded with enhanced logic, query capabilities, and visualisation tools—making it even easier to surface insights from call data.

![smart-analyst-v2](/images/release-notes/2507/smart-analyst-v2.png)

**What’s new in v2:**

- **Keyword-driven transcript filtering**
  Search transcripts via Datadog keyword queries to focus analysis on specific terms, topics, or call types.

- **Aggregated data querying**
  Smart Analyst can now generate SQL queries against an aggregated data table to identify trends and performance patterns.

- **Integrated data visualisation**
  Visual responses now include auto-generated charts mapped from query results—no need to leave the interface.

<Tip>This builds on the Smart Analyst beta introduced in June 2025, offering deeper analytical capabilities directly within the QA tooling.</Tip>
