<Accordion title="Smart Analyst enhancements" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">

Smart Analyst has been upgraded with enhanced logic, query capabilities, and visualization tools—making it even easier to surface insights from call data.

![smart-analyst-v2](/images/release-notes/2507/smart-analyst-v2.png)

**What's new?**

- **Keyword-driven transcript filtering**

  Search transcripts via Datadog keyword queries to focus analysis on specific terms, topics, or call types.
    > "Show me all calls where the customer said 'cancel my subscription'."

- **Aggregated data querying**
    > "How many calls resulted in an escalation yesterday, broken down by length of call?"

  Smart Analyst can run SQL queries against an aggregated data table and identify trends and performance patterns.

- **Integrated data visualization**
    > "Create a bar chart showing the number of failed intents over the last 7 days."

  Visual responses now include auto-generated charts mapped from query results—no need to leave the interface.

<Tip>This builds on the Smart Analyst beta introduced in June 2025, offering deeper analytical capabilities directly within the QA tooling.</Tip>

<Accordion title="Rich text refactor" icon="pen-to-square">

Input text fields have been rebuilt to support **rich text**, so adding a reference to a flow, function, SMS, or other platform element is as easy as typing **/** and then searching for it by name.

![rich-text](/images/release-notes/2507/rich-text-factoring.png)

**Key improvements:**

- You can now search by top-level menu item names, like "SMS" or "Handoff"
- The **Escape key** now closes popups.
- Open the insert menu by typing `/` or clicking the <Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" /> **plus icon**.
- Maintains support for `{{mention}}` formatting. So, for example `{{fn:SELL-abc123de}}` will show up as the function named `SELL-abc123de`.

<Accordion title="Add Amazon Polly voices" icon="waveform">

You can now add your own [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) voices to your Agent Studio project.

**What’s new:**

- Add Claude as a model option in function settings

<Accordion title="Channel filter and call metadata improvements" icon="filter">

If applicable, inbound, and web chat calls are now clearly distinguished across Agent Studio.

- **Conversation Review table** shows which number the call was placed to (callee) rather than the outbound number used.
- Column renamed to a neutral label like **“Phone Number”**
- Filtering improvements let you easily find all calls to the same callee, especially useful for outbound flows
