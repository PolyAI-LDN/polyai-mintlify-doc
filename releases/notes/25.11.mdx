<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Source Hub" icon="book" id="knowledge-source-hub">

Upload and manage multiple knowledge sources to power your KB — files, URLs, and external integrations — all from one place.
This is an improvement on the previous knowledge collection functionality from the knowledge base, and allows mature organizations with a lot of content to build and maintain quickly.

**What's new:**
- Add **multiple external knowledge sources** to populate your knowledge base.
- Supported formats include PDFs, text files, Word docs, CSVs, JSON, URLs, and CRM/helpdesk integrations.
- Assign each source to specific **client environments** and **variants**, so large deployments stay organised.
- Group sources for easier navigation and maintenance.
- Re-upload or re-scrape sources to refresh content when upstream material changes.
- Per-chunk **citations** appear in Conversation Review, showing exactly which source text informed a response and helping teams trust the agent’s reasoning.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Integrations overview page" icon="puzzle-piece" id="integrations-overview-page">

Browse a catalogue of third-party tools that Agent Studio can integrate with.

![integrations](/images/release-notes/2511/integrations.png)

**What's new:**
- New **Integrations** page listing supported tools across Telephony, Chat, CRM, Vertical, and Knowledge Base categories.
- Search by integration name or description to find what you need quickly.
- Filter by category to focus on telephony, CRM, healthcare, restaurant, hotel, or KB integrations.
- Each card shows the integration logo and a short summary of what the connection enables.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deactivate KB Topics" icon="toggle-off" id="deactivate-kb-topics">

Temporarily turn off knowledge base topics without deleting or restructuring content.

![kb-toggle](/images/release-notes/2511/kb-toggle.png)

**What’s new:**
- You can now **activate or deactivate** any KB topic from the ellipsis menu.
- Deactivated topics are **ignored by the LLM** and clearly labelled *Inactive* in the UI.
- Activation state is versioned and can differ across **Sandbox**, **Pre-release**, and **Live**.
- New **sort by inactive topics** option to help find dormant or seasonal content.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-channel dashboard" icon="chart-line" id="multi-channel-dashboard">

Agent Studio’s homepage now reflects how projects actually run: if a project uses both **voice** and **chat**, each channel now has its own homepage analytics tab.
The redesigned dashboards give clearer insight into performance, and for chat-only deployments now only relevant chat metrics will appear.

![multi-channel-dashboard](/images/release-notes/2511/homepage.png)

**What's new:**
- Split the homepage into **Voice** and **Chat** tabs, with visibility based on which channels your project uses.
- Chat tab highlights key KPIs such as engaged conversations, containment rate, total messages, cost savings, and average handle time.
- New charts for chat deployments: engaged conversations over time, messages per conversation, total message volume, top QA reasons, and containment evolution.
- Currency selector for core metrics (USD, GBP, EUR), with automatic conversion for cross-regional teams.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SMS messaging-service IDs" icon="message" id="sms-messaging-service-ids">

Agent Studio now matches how production SMS integrations are actually configured.
Messaging Service IDs replace the old, restrictive phone-number-only fields, making outbound SMS setup more flexible for enterprise deployments.

![twilio-msg-service](/images/release-notes/2511/twilio.png)

**What's new:**
- UI accepts Twilio-style Messaging Service IDs like `MGxxxxxxxxxx`.
- Replaces the previous phone-number-only validator, aligning the UI with existing API behaviour.
