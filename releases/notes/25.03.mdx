<Accordion title="Open matched topics in a new tab" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
You can now click matched [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) topics in [conversation review](/analytics/conversations/review) to open them in a new browser tab.

<Accordion title="Improved KB search for actions" icon="magnifying-glass">
The knowledge base search bar now fully indexes action keywords like [SMS](/sms/introduction), [handoff](/call-handoff/introduction), [function](/function/introduction), and [variant](/variant-management/introduction).

**What's new:**
- These terms are now searchable across the knowledge base.
