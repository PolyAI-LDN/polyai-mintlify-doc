<Accordion title="Barge-in feature" icon="microphone-slash">
This settings toggle allows you to decide if callers can interrupt agents. This can improve conversation flow and create natural, human-like interactions.the

Functionally, this feature shortens the [Voice Activation Detection (VAD)](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/comparative-analysis-personalized-voice) time and reduces [response latency](/audio-management/introduction).

To test this feature, find **Enable barge-in** in the **"Settings"** menu.

<Accordion title="Stop on keyword" icon="ban">

![control](/images/stop-keywords-response-control.png)

Stop keywords give builders control over dialogue flow by halting agent responses upon detecting specific words or phrases. These can
trigger custom functions or prevent unwanted interactions. Use this feature to configure stop keywords using **RegEx patterns.**

**Key highlights:**
- **Halt responses:** Interrupt the agent's response when certain words or phrases (configured with RegEx) are detected in user input.
- **Trigger functions:** Use Stop Keywords to activate specific functions or workflows.

**How to use:**
1. Create a function
1. Open **Response Controls** in the Build tab.
2. Add Stop Keywords and define their behavior using RegEx patterns.
3. Optionally, configure the agent to trigger a custom function or workflow when a Stop Keyword is detected.
