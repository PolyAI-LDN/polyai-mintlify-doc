The **December 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release focuses on scale and collaboration: multi-draft branching, low-code API integrations, no-code flow building, and stronger foundations for multilingual agents.

Expand the items for details:

<Accordion title="Multi-draft (Branches)" icon="code-branch" id="multi-draft-branches">

Agent Studio now supports **multi-draft development** using branches, allowing multiple people or teams to work on the same project in parallel without colliding.

This is especially valuable for organisations that need to ship urgent fixes quickly while continuing longer-term feature work — without turning Sandbox into a single shared bottleneck.

**What's new:**
- Whenever you make a change, create **branches** from the main project so work can happen in parallel.
- Branches are listed under each project, with information like the owner, creation time, and last edited.
- Merge a branch back into the main project using **Merge** (replacing **Publish**).
- Built-in **conflict resolution** shows changes side-by-side (re-using the version comparison experience) and requires resolving all conflicts before merge.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No-code flows" icon="diagram-project" id="no-code-flows">

No-code flows make it possible to build and evolve conversational logic without writing custom [functions](/function/introduction) for every step.

This lowers the barrier for external builders and partners, while still allowing advanced steps and functions where needed.

![no-code-flows](/images/release-notes/2512/no-code-flows.png)

**What's new:**
- Build flows using **default nodes** with LLM instructions, entity collection, and conditional routing.
- Drag-and-drop connections between steps without writing transition functions.
- Combine no-code steps with advanced steps in the same flow for complex scenarios.
- Improved stability and validation as no-code flows become a first-class foundation for future features.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API integrations in Agent Studio" icon="plug" id="api-integrations-in-agent-studio">

A new **API integrations** area lets you configure external endpoints directly in the UI — making API-backed agents easier to build, reuse, and maintain without bespoke glue-code per project.

This reduces the “every integration is a custom function” overhead and moves Agent Studio closer to a true low-code, partner-friendly workflow.

![api-integrations](/images/release-notes/2512/api-config.png)

**What's new:**
- New **API integrations** page listing configured endpoints with name, operation, and description.
- Configure **base URLs and authentication per environment** (Sandbox / Pre-release / Live) while keeping operation details consistent.
- Supported auth types include **No Auth**, **Basic Auth**, **API Key**, and **OAuth 2.0**.
- Use variables inside headers and body fields for dynamic runtime values.
- Call configured APIs from functions using `conv.api` (for example: `conv.api.<integration>.<operation>(...)`).
- API request and response status can be surfaced in logs for debugging and QA review.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Variant info in Test Cases" icon="list-check" id="variant-info-in-test-cases">

Test Cases can now show the **variant** they were saved against, so teams can reliably run QA against the correct configuration in variant-driven deployments.

This matters in real builds because the same prompt running on the wrong variant is effectively a different agent.

**What's new:**
- Test Case list and detail pages now display the **variant** used when the test case was saved.
- The variant column only appears for projects that use variants.
- If a referenced variant has been deleted, the UI flags the test case so it can be updated or removed.
- Variant information is intentionally **not shown on the Test Set page**, keeping sets focused on grouping and execution.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Conversation review & PolyScore enhancements" icon="chart-simple" >

Conversation Review now provides clearer, more transparent signals about **call quality and outcomes**, making it easier to understand *why* a conversation succeeded or failed — not just whether it did.

![polyscore](/images/release-notes/2512/polyscore.png)

**What's new:**
- **Redesigned conversation table and review UI** with clearer summaries and improved readability.
- **PolyScore breakdowns** now explain how scores are calculated, including:
  - Agent understanding
  - Task success and resolution quality
- Inline explanations and tooltips make scoring criteria explicit, helping teams trust and interpret QA signals instead of treating them as a black box.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Analyst live reasoning steps" icon="brain" id="smart-analyst-live-reasoning">

Smart Analyst now streams its reasoning steps live while an analysis is running, giving users immediate visibility into how conclusions are formed.

![smart-analyst-streaming](/images/release-notes/2512/smart-analyst.png)

**What's new:**
- Analysis stages are shown **progressively**.
- Users can follow the model's thinking in real time, so complex analyses are faster and more transparent.
