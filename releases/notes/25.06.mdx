The **June 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release focuses on version comparison, configuration flexibility, and UI streamlining.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Version comparison enhancements" icon="code-compare">

You can now compare versions across **functions**, **flows**, and **knowledge base** items—not just KBs.

**What's new:**

- The sidebar UI highlights additions, edits, and deletions
- View full publish history per item

<Tip>This update supports better change management for teams working across large or complex agents, especially when multiple people are working on a single item.</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent configuration" icon="sliders">

Bring dynamic, real-time settings to your agent—without touching flows or code.

![configuration-builder](/images/release-notes/2506/configuration-builder.png)

**How it works:**

- Builders define a JSON **schema** to create structured config forms
- Managers populate **values** per environment (Draft, Pre-release, Live)
- Forms appear in the **Configuration** tab once the schema is published

<Tip>This setup lets teams safely update logic—like hours, routing, or toggles—without risk to underlying functions.</Tip>

**Example uses:**

- Opening hours
- After-hours message toggles
- Fallback numbers
- Environment-specific logic flags

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Action name search and autofill" icon="pen-to-square">

![function-autofill](/images/release-notes/2506/function-autofill.png)

You can now invoke actions, like functions and SMS, by typing `/name` directly into the editor.

**Improvements include:**

- Cleaner UI for selecting actions
- Matches top-level categories and partial names
- Can better handle nested actions in the UI

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cached disclaimer messages" icon="circle-info">

Disclaimer messages are now cached in the Cache under **Audio Management**.

![cache-disclaimer](/images/release-notes/2506/disclaimer-cache.png)

**Why this helps:**

- Ensures consistent delivery of disclaimer audio
- Reduces response time when disclaimers are reused across flows or agents
- Simplifies troubleshooting when disclaimers fail to play

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart analyst (Beta)" icon="chart-line">

<Tip>This feature is currently in open beta. Reach out to your PolyAI contact for access and setup.</Tip>

![smart-analyst](/images/release-notes/2506/smart-analyst.png)

Smart Analyst is a new chatbot in Studio that reviews a random sample of your recent calls and answers natural-language questions about them.

**Ask questions like:**

- “How long are my calls on average?”
- “Which intents failed yesterday?”
- “What’s the most common escalation reason?”

**How it works:**

- Reviews call data from the past 24 hours
- Summarizes behavior patterns and performance
- Lets you explore assistant usage conversationally
