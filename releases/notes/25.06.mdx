The **June 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release focuses on version comparison, configuration flexibility, and UI streamlining.

Expand the items for details:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Version comparison enhancements" icon="code-compare">

You can now compare versions across **functions**, **flows**, and **knowledge base** items—not just KBs.

![version-comparison-v2](/images/release-notes/2506/function-editor-live-diff.png)

**What's new:**

- The sidebar UI highlights additions, edits, and deletions
- View full publish history per item

<Tip>This update supports better change management for teams working across large or complex agents, especially when multiple people are working on a single item.</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent configuration" icon="sliders">

Bring dynamic, real-time settings to your agent—without touching flows or code.

![configuration-builder](/images/release-notes/2506/configuration-builder.png)

**How it works:**

- Builders define a JSON **schema** to create structured config forms
- Managers populate **values** per environment (Draft, Pre-release, Live)
- Forms appear in the **Configuration** tab once the schema is published

<Tip>This setup lets teams safely update logic—like hours, routing, or toggles—without risk to underlying functions.</Tip>

**Example uses:**

- Opening hours
- After-hours message toggles
- Fallback numbers
- Environment-specific logic flags

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Action name search and autofill" icon="pen-to-square">

![function-autofill](/images/release-notes/2506/function-autofill.png)

You can now invoke actions, like functions and SMS, by typing `/name` directly into the editor.

**Improvements include:**

- Cleaner UI for selecting actions
- Matches top-level categories and partial names
- Can better handle nested actions in the UI

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cached disclaimer messages" icon="circle-info">

Disclaimer messages are now cached in the Cache under **Audio Management**.

![cache-disclaimer](/images/release-notes/2506/disclaimer-cache.png)

**Why this helps:**

- Ensures consistent delivery of disclaimer audio
- Reduces response time when disclaimers are reused across flows or agents
- Simplifies troubleshooting when disclaimers fail to play

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart analyst (Beta)" icon="chart-line">

<Tip>This feature is currently in open beta. Reach out to your PolyAI contact for access and setup.</Tip>

![smart-analyst](/images/release-notes/2506/smart-analyst.png)

Smart Analyst is a new chatbot in Studio that reviews a random sample of your recent calls and answers natural-language questions about them.

**Ask questions like:**

- "How long are my calls on average?"
- "Which intents failed yesterday?"
- "What's the most common escalation reason?"

**How it works:**

- Reviews call data from the past 24 hours
- Summarizes behavior patterns and performance
- Lets you explore assistant usage conversationally

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Agent memory" icon="brain">

Agent Memory allows agents to persist and recall information across conversations—like user preferences or recent bookings—using a secure key-value store.

**How it works:**

- Memory is stored per **identifier** (e.g. phone number)
- Functions can access memory via `conv.memory`
- Values are written via `conv.state` and saved at call end
- Multiple identifiers (like phone and email) can be linked to the same profile

<Tip>This is especially useful for repeat callers or omnichannel use cases, where remembering previous interactions improves containment and personalisation.</Tip>

**Example use cases:**

- Recall a user’s previous delivery date or cheese preference
- Link web and phone interactions to a shared memory profile
- Personalise greetings based on previous contact history

**Developer usage:**

```python
# Read memory
cheese = conv.memory.get("cheese_type")

# Persist memory
conv.state["cheese_type"] = "gouda"
```

<Tip>Before using this in production, a DPIA must be completed. Contact Legal or your PolyAI rep for guidance.</Tip>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Suite" icon="vial">

![test-suite](/images/release-notes/2506/test-suite.png)

The [Test Suite](/analytics/test-suite/introduction) lets you save real conversations as test cases and re-run them against draft or sandbox versions to check for behavioral drift.

**What’s new:**

- Save test cases from the chat panel or conversation review
- Re-run conversations with new parameters like contact name or phone number
- Run tests individually or batch test cases in groups
- Review success rates in the **Test Runs** tab

<Tip>Use this to catch issues when refining agents, especially when upgrading functions or dealing with variants.</Tip>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="PolyScore" icon="star">

![smart-analyst](/images/release-notes/2506/polyscore.png)

PolyScore introduces automated LLM-based scoring for conversations—directly in Conversation Review.

**What it does:**

- Assigns a score from **0–10** per call, where higher is better
- Weighs multiple behavioral and qualitative signals
- Offers fast, standardized feedback across all calls

PolyScore also appears as a filterable field in the **Conversations** tab to help teams quickly identify high- or low-performing calls.
