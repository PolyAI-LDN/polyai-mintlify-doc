<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Live call listening" icon="headphones" id="live-call-listening">

Monitor calls as they happen in real time in [Conversation Review](/analytics/conversations/introduction).

**What's new:**
- In-progress calls now appear in the **Conversations** list with a live duration indicator.
- Watch turns stream live as they occur, including metadata like timestamps and caller ID.
- Access is permission-controlled. Users without [PII-level](/function/classes/conv-log#PII) access cannot view live transcripts.
- A new tabbed view for *Live*, *Ended*, and *All* calls in the Conversations list.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Function logging (conv.log)" icon="file-lines" id="function-logging-on-agent-studio">

You can now write structured logs from inside functions using `conv.log`, with entries visible in **Conversation Review → Diagnosis** and the **Conversations API**.

**What's new:**
- Write logs directly in functions using `conv.log.info`, `conv.log.warning`, and `conv.log.error`.
- Logs are displayed inline during conversation review and exposed in the [Conversations API](/api-reference/conversations) for external monitoring.
- Mark entries as **PII** so they appear only for users with the correct permissions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Webchat customisation" icon="comments" id="advanced-webchat-customisation">

Webchat now supports configurable disclaimer messages and consent prompts to meet legal and privacy requirements.
