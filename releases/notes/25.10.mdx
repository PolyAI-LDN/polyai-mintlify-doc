<Accordion title="Live call listening" icon="headphones">

Monitor calls as they happen in real time in [Conversation Review](/analytics/conversations/introduction).

**What's new:**
- In-progress calls now appear in the **Conversations** list with live duration indicators.
- Watch turns stream live as they occur, including timestamps and caller metadata.
- Access is permission-controlled — users without [PII-level](/function/classes/conv-log#pii) access cannot view transcripts.
- A new tabbed view separates *Live*, *Ended*, and *All* calls for easier navigation.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Webchat customization" icon="comments">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Function logging (conv.log)" icon="file-lines">

Write structured logs directly from inside functions using `conv.log`, viewable in **Conversation Review → Diagnosis** and the **Conversations API**.

![conv-log](/images/release-notes/2510/conv-log.png)

**What's new:**
- Use `conv.log.info`, `conv.log.warning`, and `conv.log.error` to record structured logs.

- Mark entries as **PII** so only users with permission can view them.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Analyst templates" icon="chart-line">

Smart Analyst now opens with a new **Templates** interface — offering ready-made, categorized prompts for instant insight generation.

![smart-analyst-template](/images/release-notes/2510/analyst-template.png)

**What's new:**
- Start faster with **pre-built analysis templates**, organized by category: *Customer Insights*, *Agent Performance*, and *Custom Research*.
- Templates include optimized queries and short descriptions for clear outcomes.
- Selecting a template auto-fills the query field with a pre-configured analysis prompt.
- Each template is designed to help non-technical users explore real data and build useful reports instantly.
- Templates will expand over time with more analysis types and custom management tools.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent Analysis – scheduled batches" icon="bars-progress">

You can now schedule Agent Analysis to run **daily** or **weekly**. Automating recurring analysis tasks is a good way to continuously track the performance of your project after deployment or when it is in QA.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Email from Functions" icon="envelope">

Functions can now send templated emails directly from flows — enabling alerts, confirmations, and workflow automation.

**What's new:**
- Use `conv.send_email()` directly inside any function.
- Supports plain-text or HTML content, with optional **CC**, **BCC**, and **attachments**.
- Ideal for booking confirmations, internal notifications, or service alerts.

**Example:**
```python
conv.send_email(
  to="guest@example.com",
  subject="Reservation confirmed ✅",
  body="<p>Your booking has been confirmed. We look forward to your stay!</p>",
  cc=["manager@example.com"],
  attachments=["/mnt/data/invoice.pdf"]
)
```
