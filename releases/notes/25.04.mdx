The **April 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release introduces improvements to agent evaluation, debugging, and conversation review.

Expand the items for details:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Call categorization" icon="list-check">
You can now assess calls using an **LLM-powered review flow**. Define prompts or evaluation tasks to automatically analyse agent performance and surface relevant conversations.

![assistant-analysis](/images/release-notes/2504/call-categorization.png)

**Key features:**
- Rate calls for tone, intent success, or compliance
- Use predefined categories set per project
- Get LLM-based summaries of call performance

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enhanced diagnosis logging" icon="bug">
The conversation diagnosis view now shows **state variables** and grouped logs in real time—making it easier to debug unexpected behaviour or follow the logic of each step.

![state-variables](/images/release-notes/2504/state-vars.png)

**Why it matters:**
- View flow entry/exit, LLM calls, function outputs, and more
- Check internal state and slot values during runtime
- Debug faster without needing Datadog access

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workspace filter in Conversations" icon="window-restore">
A new workspace-level filter in the Conversations page makes it easier to review only the calls that matter to your team.

<Accordion title="Utility function – extract_address" icon="address-book">
<Note>This is an opt-in feature and will not be enabled by default. Contact PolyAI for access.</Note>

Agent Studio now supports utility functions, which will help standardize some common actions like address collection. This release introduces the first: `extract_address()`.

![extract-address-util](/images/release-notes/2504/address-util.png)

**What it does:**
- Extracts a structured address from the most recent user input using an internal LLM.
- Returns an `Address` object with fields like street name, number, postcode, and country.
- Raises a custom `ExtractionError` with clear messaging when something goes wrong.

**Usage example:**
```
try:
    address = conv.extract_address(country="US")
    conv.state.parsed_address = address
except ExtractionError as e:
    conv.state.address_error = str(e)
```

**The `Address` object includes:**
```python
@dataclass
class Address:
    street_number: Optional[str]
    street_name: Optional[str]
    city: Optional[str]
    state: Optional[str]
    postcode: Optional[str]
    country: Optional[str]
```

**Details:**
- The method may take a few seconds to run—it calls an LLM behind the scenes.
- You can optionally pass a list of expected addresses to validate against.
- Fields may be partially filled depending on input quality and model confidence.

**Why it matters:**
- Replaces fragile regex or lookup-based parsing with robust LLM-driven logic.
- Makes structured data accessible from open-ended inputs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Import and export variants" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
You can now export and import variant configurations across environments or agents—ideal for managing multi-site setups at scale.

**What you can do:**
- Export all variant data to a CSV file from the Variant Management tab.
- Make bulk edits in the CSV (e.g. opening hours, contact numbers).
- Import updated variant files into the same or different agents.

**Why it matters:**
- Scale support across multi-location businesses with consistent variant logic.
- Avoid rework by reusing variant configurations across projects.
- Align variant data with broader enterprise tools and systems.

<Tip>See the full [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) page for advanced use cases, including SMS personalization, routing, and KB integration.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Variant ID added to conversations" icon="fingerprint">
Reviewed conversations now show the **variant ID** in use during the call.

![variant-id](/images/release-notes/2504/call-variant.png)

**Why it helps:**
- Identify which variant the agent used
- Spot differences between call versions
- Improve traceability for QA and bug reports
