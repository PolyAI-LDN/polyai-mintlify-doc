The **April 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release includes new tools for call review, debugging, and utility development.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Metrics" icon="circle-three-quarters">
You can now generate **LLM-powered performance metrics** in the PolyAI Agent Studio using the new **Assistant Analysis** flow. Define a custom prompt and category set, then run it across a batch of calls to generate insight-rich evaluations and visual summaries.

![call-batch-run](/images/release-notes/2504/call-batch-run.png)

**How it works:**

- Create a custom evaluation prompt, with categories and descriptions
- Select a batch of calls via the Assistant Analysis feature.
- Automatically assess agent performance across key custom criteria like tone, intent success, or compliance (or any other potential variables)
- View results in a dedicated **Assistant Analysis UI**, with graphs showing how your calls measure up against each evaluation axis

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Call categorization" icon="list-check">
You can now use an LLM to review and rate calls.

![assistant-analysis](/images/release-notes/2504/call-categorization.png)

**What you can do:**
- Rate calls for tone, intent success, or compliance
- Use project-specific categories
- Get automatic summaries

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workspace filter in Conversations" icon="window-restore">
You can now filter conversations by workspace on the Conversations page.

![workspace-filter](/images/release-notes/2504/version-filter.png)

**Why it helps:**
- Focus on the calls your team is responsible for
- Cleaner review experience for large orgs

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Utility function – extract_address" icon="address-book">
<Note>This is an opt-in feature and will not be enabled by default. Contact PolyAI for access.</Note>

You can now extract structured address data from free-text input using a built-in LLM utility: `extract_address()`.

![extract-address-util](/images/release-notes/2504/address-util.png)

**What it does:**
- Parses the most recent user message for address info
- Returns an `Address` object with fields like street, postcode, and country
- Raises an `ExtractionError` if parsing fails

**Usage:**
```python
try:
    address = conv.extract_address(country="US")
    conv.state.parsed_address = address
except ExtractionError as e:
    conv.state.address_error = str(e)
```

**Address object:**
```python
@dataclass
class Address:
    street_number: Optional[str]
    street_name: Optional[str]
    city: Optional[str]
    state: Optional[str]
    postcode: Optional[str]
    country: Optional[str]
```

**Other details:**
- Calls an LLM, so may take a few seconds
- You can optionally validate against a list of known addresses
- Some fields may be missing depending on input quality

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Conversation history access – conv.history" icon="book-open">
You can now access earlier conversation turns from within utility functions using `conv.history`.

**What it does:**
- Returns a list of events: user inputs, agent replies, function calls, etc.
- Useful for writing context-aware logic

**Usage:**
```python
def some_function(conv: Conversation):
    history = conv.history

    for event in history:
        print(event.to_dict())

    return {
        "utterance": "Here's a response that depends on previous turns.",
        "content": f"Conversation so far: {str(history)}"
    }
```

**Why it matters:**
- Build logic based on what’s already happened in the conversation
- Avoid passing state manually
- Better debugging and flow control

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Import and export variants" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
You can now export and import variants between agents or environments.

**What you can do:**
- Export all variant data to CSV
- Edit things like contact numbers or opening hours in bulk
- Reimport to update the same or a different agent

**Why it matters:**
- Makes it easy to scale across multiple sites
- No need to rebuild variant logic from scratch
- Keeps your CSVs in sync with other tools

<Tip>See the full [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) page for advanced use cases like SMS personalisation or routing.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Variant ID added to conversations" icon="fingerprint">
Reviewed conversations now show the **variant ID** used in each call.

![variant-id](/images/release-notes/2504/call-variant.png)

**Why it matters:**
- See exactly which variant was active
- Easier to debug and compare different versions
- Adds context for QA and bug tracking
