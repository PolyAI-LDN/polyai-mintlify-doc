The **May 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release includes enhancements to variant testing, input handling, KB creation, and LLM feedback.

<Accordion title="DTMF support" icon="fingerprint">

[DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/DTMF) is the method phones use to turn keypad presses into audio tones that telecom systems can detect and process.

You can now configure DTMF collection directly inside a flow step. DTMF is often used for collecting phone numbers, booking IDs, or confirmation codes during a conversation.

![dtmf-support](/images/release-notes/2505/dtmf.png)

Click the app grid icon <Icon icon="grid" iconType="solid" /> to open the DTMF menu.

**You can configure:**

- **Inter-digit timeout**: Set the number of seconds to wait between key presses before timing out of the collection process.
- **Number of digits expected**: Specify how many digits the agent should expect.
- **End key**: Choose an optional key (like `#` or `*`) to signal the end of input.
- **Collect while speaking**: Enable data collection even while the assistant is still talking.
- **Mark as PII**: Flag the collected value as [Personally Identifiable Information](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-information-a-guide/).

<Accordion title="Chat with variants" icon="arrows-cross">

Users can now test how different [variants](/variant-management/introduction) respond using a drop down in the chat panel.

![chat-with-variants](/images/release-notes/2505/chat-with-variants.png)

**What you can do:**

* Select a specific variant to observe differences in behavior, tone, or logic

**Why it matters:**

* Easier testing
* Better confidence in how variants perform in production

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Duplicate and set default variants" icon="copy">

![set-default-variant](/images/release-notes/2505/set-default-variant.png)

You can now duplicate a variant and assign a new default variant directly from the [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) page.

**What's new:**

* Open the options menu <Icon icon="ellipsis" iconType="solid" /> to **Edit** or **Duplicate** an existing variant.
* Set a variant as default using the toggle in the side of the **Edit** panel.

Switching to a new default automatically deactivates the previous one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build KBs with URL and PDF upload" icon="file-pdf">

You can now create new [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) topics by [uploading a PDF](/essentials/imports/#pdf) or simply by [providing a website URL](/essentials/imports/#csv).

![url-upload-kb](/images/release-notes/2505/import-pdf.png)

**Features:**

* Pulls page content from public websites
    * This means you can give your agent a link to your company's FAQ and it will generate a full draft of knowledge base topics.
* Upload PDF files to generate KB topic drafts

<Tip> When using the URL option, remember some websites block scraping and that HTML-to-text fidelity may vary. Always review content carefully after importing.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Latency metadata tag" icon="clock">

![high-latency](/images/release-notes/2505/high-latency.png)

Calls with unusually high latency are now flagged automatically with a metadata tag.

**How it works:**

* Compares turn latency to weekly project baseline
* Flags any outliers as potential performance issues

**Why it matters:**

* Helps internal teams isolate laggy behavior
* Can indicate systemic issues requiring optimization

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat-to-review shortcut" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">

![review-shortcut](/images/release-notes/2505/review-shortcut.png)

A shortcut button has been added to the chat panel to open the conversation in the Review page.

**Benefits:**

* Speeds up debugging
* Useful when testing flows or functions in studio

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handoff reason and utterance" icon="phone">

The built-in **handoff** template and the `conv.handoff()` helper now accept two optional, structured fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `reason` | Machine-readable code explaining *why* the call is being escalated (e.g. `policy_violation`, `needs_human`, `no_availability`). Surfaces in Conversation Review and the Conversations API. | `policy_violation` |
| `utterance` | A short sentence the assistant should speak *before* transfer begins. Logged alongside the handoff so QA can hear exactly what callers were told. | “Let me transfer you to a specialist who can help.” |

**Where it shows up**

* **Flows & KB actions** – Selecting **builtin-handoff** now displays *Reason* and *Pre-handoff utterance* fields.
* **Functions** – Call `conv.handoff(reason="...", utterance="...")` to escalate programmatically.
* **Conversation Review** – Both fields appear in the metadata panel for quick troubleshooting.
* **Conversations API** – Returned inside the `handoff` object for BI dashboards or CRM routing.

**Why it matters**

* Removes guess-work when diagnosing handoffs—no more relying on LLM summaries alone.
* Enables fine-grained routing rules in telephony or CRM systems.
* Gives QA teams full visibility into the exact wording customers heard.
