The **May 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release includes enhancements to variant testing, input handling, KB creation, and LLM feedback.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="DTMF support" icon="fingerprint">

DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) allows users to input numbers using a telephone keypad. You can now configure DTMF collection directly within a flow step, making it easier to capture numeric data from callers—like phone numbers, booking IDs, or confirmation codes—during a conversation.

**You can configure:**

- **Inter-digit timeout**: Set the number of seconds to wait between key presses (e.g. 3–15 seconds).
- **Number of digits expected**: Specify how many digits the user should input (e.g. 8 for a UK phone number).
- **End key**: Choose an optional key (like `#` or `*`) to signal the end of input, or use “No end key.”
- **Collect while speaking**: Allow data collection even while the assistant is still talking.
- **Mark as PII**: Flag the collected value as Personally Identifiable Information.

This enables accurate data capture even in noisy environments or where speech recognition might fail.

<Accordion title="Chat with variants" icon="arrows-cross">

Users can now test how different [variants](/variant-management/introduction) respond directly in the chat panel.

![chat-with-variants](/images/release-notes/2505/chat-with-variants.png)

**What you can do:**

* Select a specific variant, draft, or sandbox version when chatting
* Observe differences in behavior, tone, or logic
* Use for quick QA and regression testing across deployments

**Why it matters:**

* Easier A/B testing
* Better confidence in how variants perform in production

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Duplicate and set default variants" icon="copy">

![set-default-variant](/images/release-notes/2505/set-default-variant.png)

You can now duplicate a variant and assign a new default directly from [variant management](/variant-management/introduction).

**What's new:**

* Use the 3-dot menu to **Edit** or **Duplicate** an existing variant.
* Set a variant as default using the toggle in the side of the **Edit** panel.
* Switching to a new default automatically deactivates the previous one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build KBs with URL and PDF upload" icon="file-pdf">

You can now create KB topics by uploading PDFs or providing a website URL.

![url-upload-kb](/images/release-notes/2505/import-pdf.png)

**Features:**

* Pulls page content from public websites
* Upload PDF files to generate KB topic drafts

**Known limits:**

* Some websites block scraping
* HTML-to-text fidelity may vary; always review content post-import

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Latency metadata tag" icon="clock">

![high-latency](/images/release-notes/2505/high-latency.png)

Calls with unusually high latency are now flagged automatically with a metadata tag.

**How it works:**

* Compares turn latency to weekly project baseline
* Flags any outliers as potential performance issues

**Why it matters:**

* Helps internal teams isolate laggy behavior
* Can indicate systemic issues requiring optimization

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat-to-review shortcut" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">

![review-shortcut](/images/release-notes/2505/review-shortcut.png)

A shortcut button has been added to the chat panel to open the conversation in the Review page.

**Benefits:**

* Speeds up debugging
* Useful when testing flows or functions in studio

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="LLM annotations" icon="marker">

Users can now rate LLM-generated utterances directly with thumbs up/down.

**How it helps:**

* Tracks output quality over time
* Provides feedback signals for fine-tuning

**Future capabilities (coming soon):**

* Suggest corrected outputs
* Customize feedback categories

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handoff reason and utterance" icon="phone">

The built-in **handoff** template and the `conv.handoff()` helper now accept two optional, structured fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `reason` | Machine-readable code explaining *why* the call is being escalated (e.g. `policy_violation`, `needs_human`, `no_availability`). Surfaces in Conversation Review and the Conversations API. | `policy_violation` |
| `utterance` | A short sentence the assistant should speak *before* transfer begins. Logged alongside the handoff so QA can hear exactly what callers were told. | “Let me transfer you to a specialist who can help.” |

**Where it shows up**

* **Flows & KB actions** – Selecting **builtin-handoff** now displays *Reason* and *Pre-handoff utterance* fields.
* **Functions** – Call `conv.handoff(reason="...", utterance="...")` to escalate programmatically.
* **Conversation Review** – Both fields appear in the metadata panel for quick troubleshooting.
* **Conversations API** – Returned inside the `handoff` object for BI dashboards or CRM routing.

**Why it matters**

* Removes guess-work when diagnosing handoffs—no more relying on LLM summaries alone.
* Enables fine-grained routing rules in telephony or CRM systems.
* Gives QA teams full visibility into the exact wording customers heard.
