The **May 2025** PolyAI Agent Studio release includes enhancements to variant testing, input handling, KB creation, and LLM feedback.

Expand the items for details:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="DTMF support" icon="fingerprint">

[DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/DTMF) is the method phones use to turn keypad presses into audio tones that telecom systems can detect and process.

You can now configure DTMF collection directly inside a flow step. DTMF is often used for collecting phone numbers, booking IDs, or confirmation codes during a conversation.

![dtmf-support](/images/release-notes/2505/dtmf.png)

Click the app grid icon <Icon icon="grid" iconType="solid" /> to open the DTMF menu.

**You can configure:**

- **Inter-digit timeout**: Set the number of seconds to wait between key presses before timing out of the collection process.
- **Number of digits expected**: Specify how many digits the agent should expect.
- **End key**: Choose an optional key (like `#` or `*`) to signal the end of input.
- **Collect while speaking**: Enable data collection even while the agent is still talking.
- **Mark as PII**: Flag the collected value as [Personally Identifiable Information](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-information-a-guide/).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat with variants" icon="arrows-cross">

Users can now test how different [variants](/variant-management/introduction) respond using a drop down in the chat panel.

![chat-with-variants](/images/release-notes/2505/chat-with-variants.png)

**What you can do:**

* Select a specific variant to observe differences in behavior, tone, or logic

**Why it matters:**

* Easier testing
* Better confidence in how variants perform in production

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Duplicate and set default variants" icon="copy">

![set-default-variant](/images/release-notes/2505/set-default-variant.png)

You can now duplicate a variant and assign a new default variant directly from the [variant management](/variant-management/introduction) page.

**What's new:**

* Open the options menu <Icon icon="ellipsis" iconType="solid" /> to **Edit** or **Duplicate** an existing variant.
* Set a variant as default using the toggle in the side of the **Edit** panel.

Switching to a new default automatically deactivates the previous one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build KBs with URL and PDF upload" icon="file-pdf">

You can now create new [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) topics by [uploading a PDF](/essentials/imports/#pdf) or simply by [providing a website URL](/essentials/imports/#csv).

![url-upload-kb](/images/release-notes/2505/import-pdf.png)

**Features:**

* Pulls page content from public websites
    * This means you can give your agent a link to your company's FAQ and it will generate a full draft of knowledge base topics.
* Upload PDF files to generate KB topic drafts

<Tip> When using the URL option, remember some websites block scraping and that HTML-to-text fidelity may vary. Always review content carefully after importing. </Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat-to-review shortcut" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">

![review-shortcut](/images/release-notes/2505/review-shortcut.png)

A shortcut button has been added to the chat panel to open the conversation in the Review page.

**Benefits:**

* Speeds up debugging
* Useful when testing flows or functions in studio

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handoff reason and utterance" icon="phone">

The built-in **handoff** template and the `conv.handoff()` helper now accept two optional, structured fields for clearer call logging and routing:

```python
def escalate(conv: Conversation):
    return conv.handoff(
        reason="policy_violation",
        utterance="Let me transfer you to a specialist who can help."
    )
```

| Field      | Purpose                                                                                                   | Example |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `reason`   | Machine-readable code explaining *why* the call is being escalated (e.g. `policy_violation`, `needs_human`, `no_availability`). Surfaces in [Conversation Review](/analytics/conversations/review) and the [Conversations API](/api-reference/conversations). | `policy_violation` |
| `utterance`| The exact phrase the agent should speak *before* initiating the transfer. Logged alongside the handoff.  | "Let me transfer you to a specialist who can help." |

**Where it shows up**

* **Flows & KB Actions** – When using the `builtin-handoff` action, you can now optionally specify `reason` and `utterance` fields inside the action configuration (visible in the JSON behind the scenes, not in the Handoff Destination UI).
* **Functions** – Call `conv.handoff(reason="...", utterance="...")` directly in the Function Editor to trigger a handoff with these fields.
* **Conversation Review** – Both fields appear in the metadata panel for visibility and QA.
* **Conversations API** – Returned inside the `handoff` object for downstream routing.

These fields **do not appear in the Call Handoff Destination UI** (where you configure SIP methods, URIs, or SIP headers).
They are attached **at runtime, when the agent decides to escalate the call**, and are logged alongside the handoff action.

**Why it matters**

* Removes guess-work when diagnosing handoffs—QA no longer has to rely on LLM summaries alone.
* Enables fine-grained routing rules in telephony or CRM systems.
* Ensures the exact agent wording before handoff is logged and auditable.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Entities and intents in Conversation Review" icon="bullseye">

![entities-intents](/images/release-notes/2505/intents-entities.png)

[Conversation Review](/analytics/conversations/review) now shows detected intents and extracted entities directly in the Diagnosis panel, making it easier to debug and QA conversations that use intents or entities.

**What's new:**

- **Intents**: Shows the triggered intent from the agent’s recognition model (for pre-GenAI intent-based projects).
- **Entities**: Lists extracted key data points, such as booking numbers, customer IDs, or locations.
