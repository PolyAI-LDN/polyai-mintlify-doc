<Note>
Source Hub is in **beta**. Behavior may change as we extend supported integrations and scale performance.
</Note>

**Source Hub** lets you connect and manage multiple external knowledge sources so your agent can reference accurate, up-to-date information when responding to customer queries. It is designed for teams whose knowledge is distributed across articles, documentation sites, support platforms, and internal materials that change over time.

## Why use multiple knowledge sources?

Your organisation may have knowledge living in:

- product documentation websites
- policy and compliance PDFs
- help desk systems such as **Zendesk** or **Gladly**
- CSV, JSON or internal reference files
- departmental or seasonal knowledge held in separate systems

Source Hub allows you to bring these together, update them in-situ, and reuse them across agent projects without rewriting content.

## Supported source types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Upload files** | PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV, JSON |
| **URL scraping** | Documentation pages, help center articles |
| **Zendesk** *(beta)* | Help center + API access |
| **Gladly** *(beta)* | Knowledge source sync |

## Add a new source

1. Go to **Build → Source Hub**
2. Select **New source**
3. Choose one of:
   - **Upload files**
   - **Add URL**
   - **Zendesk**
   - **Gladly**
4. Complete the required details and click **Add**

Your agent will begin **Syncing** the content. Once ready, the source appears in the list.

## Keeping content fresh

After content changes in your external sources:

- click **Update** to re-scrape files or URLs
- or use the **Sync** icon on individual sources

<Warning>
If a URL requires login or credentials change, syncing may fail. Update access and retry.
</Warning>

## Group and manage sources

For large knowledge estates, you can group sources:

- by product line
- by internal team
- by language or geography
- by document type (legal, support, onboarding, etc.)

Sources can be sorted by **newest**, **oldest**, **type**, or **name**, and each offers actions:

- **Sync**
- **Rename**
- **Move to group**
- **Remove**
