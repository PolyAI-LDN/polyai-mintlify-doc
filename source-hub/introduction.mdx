<Note>
Source Hub is in **beta**. Behaviour may change as we extend supported integrations and scale performance.
</Note>

**Source Hub** lets you connect and manage external knowledge sources so your agent can reference accurate, up-to-date information when responding to customer queries. It is designed for organisations whose knowledge is spread across documentation sites, help desk systems, PDFs and internal materials that change over time.

## What is Source Hub?

Source Hub is a fast, low-touch way of exposing external knowledge to your agent. You can connect URLs, files, or platform integrations, keep them synced, and toggle availability across environments or variants — without curating a separate knowledge base.

Source Hub does **not** replace the Knowledge Base. They work together, and each offers different levels of control and complexity.

## Why use multiple knowledge sources?

Your organisation may have knowledge living in:

- product documentation websites
- policy and compliance PDFs
- help desk systems such as **Zendesk** or **Gladly**
- CSV, JSON or internal reference files
- departmental or seasonal knowledge held in separate systems

Source Hub brings these together, keeps them updated in situ, and lets you reuse them across projects without rewriting content.

## How Source Hub differs from the Knowledge Base

Both Source Hub and the Knowledge Base expose information to your agent. The distinction lies in **control**, **complexity**, and **capability**:

**Source Hub**
- A connection layer for external knowledge.
- Fast to set up and simple to manage.
- Ideal for FAQ-style agents and large volumes of continuously updated content.
- No prompting skill required; no need to curate another knowledge base.
- **Cannot**: trigger actions, flows, SMS, hand-offs, or other agentic functions.
- **Cannot**: specify utterances or control when/why the agent uses specific pieces of information.

**Knowledge Base**
- A curated library of topics and prompts.
- Offers fine-grained control over utterances, behaviours, and what the agent says.
- Can trigger functions, flows, and other agentic actions.
- Requires more time, expertise, and maintenance — but enables anything beyond a simple FAQ bot.

### TL;DR

| Feature | Pain points solved | Use cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source Hub** | • Avoid creating another curated knowledge base<br>• Non-technical users want simple, fast knowledge management | • FAQ bots<br>• Rapidly adding/managing external knowledge<br>• Controlling data access per environment/variant |
| **Knowledge Base** | • Need to trigger actions/functions/flows/SMS<br>• Need precise control over utterances | • Agentic agents<br>• Curated, stable knowledge<br>• Complex behaviours and logic |

## Add a new source

1. Go to **Build → Source Hub**
2. Select **New source**
3. Choose one of:
   - **Upload files**
   - **Add URL**
   - **Zendesk**
   - **Gladly**
4. Complete the required details and click **Add**

![new-source](/images/add-new-source.png)

Your agent will begin **Syncing** the content. Once ready, the source appears in the list.

## Supported source types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Upload files** | PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV, JSON |
| **URL scraping** | Documentation pages, help centre articles |
| **Zendesk** *(beta)* | Help centre + API access |
| **Gladly** *(beta)* | Knowledge source sync |

## What exactly gets scraped when I upload a URL?

Source Hub uses a third-party scraper that traverses linked pages, but with limits:

1. **Depth** → Only one level below the initial URL.
2. **Breadth** → A maximum of 10 embedded pages.

If your page contains more than 10 links, not all will be scraped. In that case, upload additional URLs individually or rely on integrations like Zendesk/Gladly for complete coverage.

<Note>
We plan to allow adjustable depth/breadth in future updates — both for performance and to avoid scraping unnecessary or duplicate pages.
</Note>

## Keeping content fresh

After external content changes:

- click **Update** to re-scrape files or URLs
- or use the **Sync** icon per source

<Warning>
If a URL requires login or credentials change, syncing may fail. Update access and retry.
</Warning>

## Group and manage sources

Group sources by product line, team, region, or document type. Sort by **newest**, **oldest**, **type**, or **name**. Each source offers:

- **Sync**
- **Rename**
- **Move to group**
- **Remove**

## Why isn’t my agent using the sources I connected?

Several factors affect retrieval:

### Data structure
Source Hub splits content into 2000-character chunks with 500-character overlap. Very large documents or widely separated related sections may dilute relevance.

**What to do:**
- Restructure documents into smaller, tighter pieces.
- Repeat key headings or terms.
- Or curate the material as a Knowledge Base topic for guaranteed usage.

### Update state
Two updates must be current:

- **Source Update** → keeps the data in each source fresh
- **Agent Update** → applies Source Hub changes to the agent

Both can be triggered manually. Agent updates also run automatically every few minutes.

### Environments, variants, saved changes
Each source must be enabled in the correct **environment** and **variant**. Any edits must be **saved** before leaving the page.

## Conflicting information

If the Knowledge Base and Source Hub contain conflicting data, **the Knowledge Base wins**. KB content is always prioritised.

## Differences in URL results: Source Hub vs Knowledge Base

Source Hub uses a specialised third-party scraper.
Knowledge Base URL import uses an internal, older scraper with more limited coverage.

This means URL imports in the Knowledge Base may miss pages or extract less usable content.

## Tips & tricks

- **Use PolyAI’s Raven LLM** for best results — it paraphrases structured and unstructured content more naturally.
- Source Hub results receive a small bias boost to encourage use; this can be tuned if needed.
- Source Hub data and Knowledge Base topics are merged at runtime.
  - Any system-prompt style guidance applies to both (e.g., if you tell the agent to “speak like a cowboy,” both KB and Source Hub content will be cowboy-ified).

If you remain unsure why a source isn’t being used, please reach out to your PolyAI contact.
