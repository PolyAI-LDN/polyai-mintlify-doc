**Assistant Analysis** uses an LLM to analyze and categorize calls based on a configurable prompt and list of categories. You can use it to generate quick, repeatable analysis of conversation quality and outcomes across groups of calls of up to **250**.

## Overview

Each agent can have one active analysis configuration. Once this is set up, batches of up to 250 calls can be grouped and processed, returning one category per call. Results are displayed in a visual breakdown and can be reviewed or adjusted manually.

## How it works

<Steps>

<Step title="1. Create or edit your analysis configuration">
![assistant-analysis-config](/images/analysis-config.png)
Go to **Assistant Analysis** and open **Analysis configuration**. The configuration includes:
- A **Prompt** describing the task, e.g. "You are a call center manager assessing assistant performance"
- A **Question** to guide the LLM's judgment, e.g. *Is the call good?*
- A set of **Categories** â€” each with a name, description, and color
</Step>

<Step title="2. Group calls for analysis">
Click **Create group**. This opens the [Conversations](/analytics/conversations/introduction) view, where calls can be filtered and selected.
</Step>

<Step title="3. View results">
Once the group is created, it appears on the **Assistant Analysis** page. Each group shows a visual breakdown of categories and a list of processed calls.

Click **Open** to open a list of individual calls and where you can view [transcripts](/call-data/studio-transcripts) and other data.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Edit if needed">
Category assignments can be edited manually. These changes persist unless the call is reprocessed in a new batch.
</Step>
