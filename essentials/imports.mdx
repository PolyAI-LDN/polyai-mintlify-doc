description: Use CSV, PDF, and URL to upload multiple knowledge base topics or variants
---

You can upload [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) items and [variants](/variant-management/introduction) to Agent Studio using a `.csv` file, PDF, or URL. This is useful when migrating from another system, doing bulk updates, or working with external teams.

## CSV

<Note>
There are two separate import tools â€” one for the knowledge base and one for variant management. Each one has its own required format.
</Note>

### Knowledge base format

The knowledge base importer expects a file with these columns:

| Column            | Required | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic            | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2ecc71" size={14} /> | The title of the KB topic.                                         |
| Sample Questions | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2ecc71" size={14} /> | Use `\n` to separate multiple questions within one cell.           |
| Content          | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2ecc71" size={14} /> | Main answer text.                                                 |
| Actions          | <Icon icon="x" iconType="solid" color="#e74c3c" size={14} /> | Optional: workflows (handoff, SMS, function, etc.)                |

<Warning>
The final column **must** be named `Actions` (plural). Using `Action` (singular) will trigger a generic upload error: **"Problems occurred when uploading csv file."**
</Warning>

### Variant management format

The Variant importer expects a CSV with a header row listing all the variant attribute names (e.g. `site`, `location`, `language`). Each row defines one variant and its values.

```
name,location,language
Site 1,New York,en
Site 2,Barcelona,es
```

- The first column is always the **name** of the variant.
- Other columns match the attribute names you've defined in the Variant UI.

<Note>
Importing a CSV here will **overwrite** any existing variants. Re-download the template if you're unsure of the current format.
</Note>

### Tips

- Use the CSV templates provided in the UI.
- Always preview changes before clicking **Import**.
- If something fails, check for:
  - Incorrect or missing header names (especially `Actions`)
  - Commas inside fields (wrap field in double quotes)
  - Non-UTF-8 encodings

## PDF

You can upload knowledge base topics directly from a PDF. This is useful when converting existing documents like guides and policy documents into structured KB topics.

- Each page becomes a series of separated knowledge base topics.
- Content is automatically extracted from the body text.

<Warning>
Formatting, tables, and complex layouts may not convert perfectly. Always preview the imported topics and edit as needed.
</Warning>

## URL

You can also import knowledge base topics by providing a public URL. The page contents will be extracted and separated into various KB topics.

This is useful for pulling content from existing web help centers or documentation pages.

<Note>
When importing from URL, any existing content for that topic will be **overwritten**.
</Note>

<Warning>
This method works best with **clean, article-style pages**. Complex web apps, forms, or interactive content may not be imported correctly.
</Warning>
