## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based
and generative approaches to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated content. RAG combines the strengths of both retrieval
and generation to provide more informed and contextually appropriate responses.

## Components of RAG

1. **Retrieval component**: Searches the knowledge base for relevant information based on the input query.

2. **Augmentation**: Uses retrieved information to enhance the original query with additional context.

3. **Generation component**: Generates responses using a language model, integrating both the query and retrieved information.

## How RAG powers our voice bots

We leverage RAG to enhance the performance of our voice bot by combining retrieval and generation capabilities. Here’s how it works in the PolyAI Agent Studio:

1. **Query processing**: When a caller provides a query, the RAG framework is initiated.

2. **Retrieval**: RAG acts as a retriever, searching our structured knowledge base to find matching topics. The knowledge base is organized to optimize RAG’s performance and ensure precise matches.

3. **Generation**: The language model (LLM) uses the retrieved information to decide on the content to present to the caller, ensuring responses are relevant and context-aware.

## Knowledge base structure for RAG

Our knowledge base is designed to maximize the effectiveness of RAG. Each topic in the knowledge base is categorized and includes the following components:

* **Topic**: The FAQ name or category of the information.

* **Sample Questions**: Example queries that callers might use. These help RAG understand user intent and improve matching accuracy.

* **Content**: The information we want the LLM to provide to users.

* **Action**: Specific actions triggered by the query, such as calling a function, initiating a workflow, or handing off to a human agent.

## Why we use RAG for GenAI

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers several benefits that enhance the performance of our GenAI capabilities:

* **Improved query understanding:** By including sample questions in the knowledge base, RAG can better interpret user intent and deliver accurate results.

* **Enhanced accuracy and relevance:** RAG provides informed and contextually appropriate responses by retrieving the most relevant information for each query.

* **Scalability and efficiency:** The framework uses existing databases without requiring extensive retraining, making it adaptable to various domains.

* **Customized domain responses:** RAG can be tailored to specific industries or use cases, ensuring high-quality and domain-specific interactions.
