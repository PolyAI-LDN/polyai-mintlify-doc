## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based
and generative approaches to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated content. RAG leverages the strengths of both retrieval
and generation to provide more informed and contextually appropriate responses.

## Components of RAG

1. Retrieval Component: Searches the Knowledge Base for relevant information based on the input query.
2. Augmentation: Uses retrieved information to enhance the original query with additional context.
3. Generation Component: Generates responses using a language model, integrating both the query and retrieved information.

## Why we use RAG for GenAI

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers enhanced accuracy and relevance by providing informed and contextually appropriate responses. RAG
is scalable and efficient, utilizing existing databases without the need for extensive retraining and can be customized for specific domains. This approach
 improves customer experience through personalized, consistent interactions, and ensures high-quality responses.
