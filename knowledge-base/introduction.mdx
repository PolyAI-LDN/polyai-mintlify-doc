description: 'The knowledge base is where you can specify topics for your assistant to help callers with. A topic, typically representing an FAQ, contains three sections: "Topic", "Content" and "Actions". In the Content section, add information on the FAQ to teach the assistant how it should answer that type of question. In the Actions section, you can reference function calls to instruct the assistant to execute an action when the topic is triggered.'
