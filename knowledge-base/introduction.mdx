title: Overview

The **knowledge base** is the backbone of your assistant's configuration. It organizes topics and interactions that guide responses to user queries. Each topic typically represents a single FAQ or use case and contains three key parts:

1. **Topic name**: A concise, descriptive title summarizing the topic.
2. **Content**: The main information, including sample queries and model answers.
3. [**Actions**](./how-to-setup-action/introduction): Follow-up workflows triggered by the topic, like sending SMS messages or handing off to a live agent.

A well-structured knowledge base ensures your assistant retrieves accurate information, performs tasks reliably, and delivers a consistent user experience.

## Key components of a topic

### Topic name
- **Clarity and precision**: Use clear, descriptive titles such as *"Opening Hours"* or *"Refund Policy"* that reflect the topic's content.
- **Analytics impact**: Topic names influence search accuracy, dashboard analytics, and reporting.
- **Best practice**: Avoid generic or overly broad names that can lead to misretrieval.

### Content section
- **Core information**: Add concise, actionable content that directly addresses user questions. Write in the tone you expect the assistant to use.
- **Example queries**: Include 2–3 sample questions to improve retrieval accuracy.
  - *Example for "Refund Policy"*:
    - "How can I get a refund?"
    - "What is your return policy?"

- **Organize large topics**: Break down complex topics into logical, smaller sections to ensure clarity and precision.

### Actions section
The Actions section allows the assistant to perform workflows beyond delivering answers.

- **Common actions**:
  - Sending SMS messages.
  - Triggering a handoff to a live agent.
  - Invoking custom functions (e.g., fetching live data).

- **Structured instructions**: Clearly define what should happen when a topic is triggered.
  - *Example*:
    `"If the user asks for emergency assistance, trigger a handoff to a live agent in the support queue."`

## Best practices for building a knowledge base

### Write clear, actionable content
- Use direct language that is easy for users to understand.
- Keep content concise and avoid ambiguity.

### Add examples to guide retrieval
- Include 2–10 sample user queries per topic.
- Use these examples to clarify the scope of the topic for the assistant.

*Example for “Payment Issues”:*
- **User query**: “Why is my card not working?”
- **Model answer**: “Please check if your card details are correct or try using another card.”

### Simplify and structure topics
- Group related questions under a single topic if they share similar contexts (e.g., “Store Information” can include *Store Hours* and *Store Locations*).
- Avoid overloading topics with unrelated information.

### Plan for risky or critical scenarios
- Identify high-risk situations (e.g., refunds, emergencies, escalations) and create clear KB topics or rules to handle them.
- Add specific instructions or actions to ensure these scenarios are managed effectively.

*Example*:
- **Topic**: Refund Requests
- **Action**: “Trigger handoff to the billing team for refund-related queries.”

### Define and test actions
- Use the **Actions** field to link workflows like SMS notifications, function calls, or handoffs.
- Test actions thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected in real scenarios.

## Notes on global rules

- **Consistency**: Use [global rules](/agent-settings/rules) to set tone, style, and boundaries for assistant behavior across all topics.
- **Examples in rules**: Include sample responses to guide the assistant's tone and length.

*Example*:
- Rule: “Respond in a professional tone and limit responses to two sentences.”

## Iterate and improve
- Continuously test and refine your knowledge base based on real conversations. Monitor performance to identify gaps or improve clarity.
- Update example queries and responses as needed to ensure the assistant aligns with user expectations.

By following these best practices, you'll create a knowledge base that improves retrieval accuracy, enhances user interactions, and ensures reliable assistant performance.
