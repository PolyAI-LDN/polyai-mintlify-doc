The knowledge base (KB) is the brain of your agent. Each topic defines a single intent — how users might phrase it, what the agent should say, and what it should do next.

Well-structured entries keep answers clear, safe, and meaningful.

## How retrieval works

![retrieval](/images/kb-rag-ven.png)

The agent **does not** see the entire knowledge base every time. Instead, it uses [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction) to find the best match for the user’s message.

1. The retriever compares the message to the topic’s **name**, **sample questions**, and **content** — with higher weighting given to the name and sample questions.
2. It returns the top few matching topics.
3. The model selects one and generates a reply (and may trigger an **action**, **function**, or **flow transition**).

## Types of knowledge base entries

Below are the broad categories that most knowledge base entries tend to fall into.

### Simple FAQ

Used when the agent just needs to answer a question with no follow-up or action required.

#### Single turn

One message in, one message out.

- Add a short, helpful reply in `content`.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Pet policy (single turn)**
![simple_FAQ_single_turn-pet_policy](/images/kb-single-turn-pet-policy.png)

#### Multi turn

Ask a clarifying question before giving the answer.

- Use branching inside `content` to structure the reply.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Pet policy (multi-turn)**

### Handoff

Used when the agent should offer to connect the user to a human agent.

#### Offer

Agent replies, then offers to transfer.

- `content`: Include the answer and the offer.
- `actions`: Trigger `transfer_call` (or another handoff function) only if the user accepts.

**Example – Spa booking**
![handoff_offer-spa](/images/kb-handoff-spa.png)

#### Direct

Immediate transfer with no agent reply.

- Leave `content` empty.
- Always run `transfer_call` in `actions`.

**Example – Billing handoff**

#### Conditional

Transfer based on user clarification — for example, group size or request type.

- `content`: Ask a disambiguating question.
- `actions`: Map each answer to the correct destination.

**Example – Room reservations**
![handoff_conditional-room_reservation](/images/kb-handoff-conditional.png)

### Outbound messaging

Used when you want to follow up with a link or information by text or chat (SMS or WhatsApp).

#### Offer

Offer to send a link via message.

- `content`: Include a short message and ask for consent.
- `actions`: If accepted, call `start_sms_flow`.

**Example – Golf info**
![SMS_offer-golf](/images/kb-handoff-sms.png)

#### Conditional

Let the user choose which message to receive.

- `content`: Ask a branching question.
- `actions`: Map answers to different `sms_id`s.

**Example – Tee time booking**
![SMS_conditional-golf_booking](/images/kb-sms-conditional.png)

### Info only

Used for static reference material (like opening hours or prices). No interaction or action required.

- Fill `content`.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Opening hours**
![misc_info_dump_opening_hours](/images/kb-misc-info.png)

## Best practices

**Do this:**
- Use specific topic names.
- Add 5–10 realistic sample phrasings.
- Keep replies short, helpful, and on-brand.
- Use `actions` only when necessary.
- Split multi-part flows into separate turns or topics.

**Avoid this:**
- Bundling multiple intents into one topic.
- Running more than one action per turn.
- Using vague topic names like `Misc`, `Help`, or `Info`.
