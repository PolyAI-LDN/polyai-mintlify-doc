The knowledge base is a core component of your assistant's configuration. It defines the topics and interactions around which all user queries are built. Each topic typically represents a single FAQ or use case, containing three main sections:

1. **Topic Name**: A concise, descriptive title that reflects the content of the topic.
2. **Content**: Key information and example queries that guide the assistant in responding accurately.
3. [**Actions**](./how-to-setup-action/introduction): Follow-up tasks or workflows triggered by the topic, such as sending an SMS or handing off to a human agent.

By structuring your knowledge base effectively, you enable the assistant to retrieve the right information, perform actions, and handle scenarios reliably.

### Key Components of a Topic

#### Topic Name
- **Clarity and Precision**: Choose descriptive names like "Opening Hours" or "Refund Policy" that clearly reflect the topic's focus.
- **Impact on Analytics**: Names influence reporting, citations, and search accuracy in dashboards.
- **Best Practice**: Avoid overly broad or generic titles to minimize retrieval errors.

#### Content Section
- **Core Information**: Include concise, on-brand responses that directly address user queries.
- **Example Queries**: Provide 2–3 sample queries per topic to refine retrieval accuracy. For example:
  - Topic: *Refund Policy*
    Queries: "How can I get a refund?" or "What is your return policy?"
- **Organization**: Break down large or complex topics into logical subsections to ensure clarity and precision.

#### Actions Section
- **Defining Actions**: Use this section to outline follow-up tasks, such as:
  - Sending an SMS to a user.
  - Initiating a handoff to a human agent.
  - Triggering a specific workflow.
- **Structured Prompts**: Clearly define what the assistant should do, e.g.,
  `"If the user requests assistance, send an SMS using send_help_sms()."`

### Best Practices for Building a Knowledge Base

#### Use Clear and Direct Language
- Write content as it would be spoken by the assistant.
- Avoid ambiguous terms and focus on actionable, easy-to-understand information.

#### Incorporate Examples for Guidance
- Add user query examples to each topic to enhance retrieval accuracy.
- Use few-shot prompts to guide the assistant toward providing concise and accurate answers.

#### Simplify Large FAQs
- Consolidate related topics to reduce misretrieval risks. For example, group questions about "Store Locations" under a single topic with subcategories.

#### Plan for Risky Scenarios
- Identify high-risk interactions, such as refunds or emergencies, and create specific topics or rules to address them effectively.

#### Define Actions Thoughtfully
- Use the Actions section to establish clear handoff instructions or SMS templates.
- Example: *"If the user asks about emergency assistance, transfer them to a live agent."*

### Notes on Global Rules and Structure

#### Establish Consistent Behavior
- Use **Global Rules** to standardize the assistant’s behavior across all interactions. This includes tone, response length, and instructions for deferring specific queries.
- Example: *“Always respond in a professional tone and limit responses to two sentences.”*

#### Test and Iterate
- Continuously observe the assistant’s performance in real scenarios and refine the knowledge base to address gaps or misinterpretations.

#### Structured Examples
- Provide detailed user queries and model responses in the Content section to help the assistant understand the desired tone, style, and depth of responses.
- Example Query: *“What time do you open?”*
  Example Response: *“Our opening hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday.”*

By adhering to these best practices and maintaining a structured knowledge base, you can ensure that your assistant provides accurate, reliable, and professional interactions across various use cases.
