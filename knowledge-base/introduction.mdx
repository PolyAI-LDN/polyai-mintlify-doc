The knowledge base is the core component of your assistant's configuration, where you specify the topics around which all of your caller interactions will be built. Each topic typically represents a single FAQ or use case and contains three main sections:

* **Topic**: The name of the topic, which should be descriptive and self-explanatory.

* **Content**: The section where you add information for the assistant to use when answering a question. This may include model answers or helpful details for the assistant to provide to the user.

* [**Actions**](./how-to-setup-action/introduction): This section allows you to reference function calls or define actions the assistant should perform, such as sending an SMS or handing off the caller to a human agent.

### Key components of a topic

1. **Topic names**

   * Use clear, concise, and descriptive names.

   * Ensure the topic name reflects the content to improve retrieval accuracy.

2. **Content section**

   * Include key information the assistant should provide in response to the topic.

   * Add a few example user queries to help refine retrieval accuracy. For example, under a topic like “Refund Policy,” you might add queries like “How can I get a refund?” or “What is your return policy?”

   * Keep the information concise and split large FAQs into logical subsections if necessary.

3. **Actions section**

   * Full page: [Actions](./how-to-setup-action/introduction)

   * Define any follow-up actions the assistant should take when this topic is triggered.

   * Include clear instructions for actions such as sending an SMS or initiating a handoff to a human agent.

   * Use structured prompts like: `“If the user specifies they need help, send SMS using the template defined in the function send_help_sms().”`

### Best practices for the knowledge base

1. **Use clear and structured language**

   * Write the content as you would want it to be spoken by the assistant.

   * Avoid ambiguous terms and provide direct, actionable information.

2. **Think about risky scenarios**

   * Identify high-risk scenarios, such as refunds or emergencies, and ensure you create global rules or specific topics to handle these effectively.

3. **Use examples and few-shot prompting**

   * Provide examples of expected user queries and responses to guide the assistant's behavior.

   * For example: “What time do you open?” Model response: “Our opening hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday.”

4. **Simplify large topics**

   * Group related FAQs under a single topic when they share overlapping contexts to reduce the chance of misretrieval.

5. **Plan for handoffs and SMS actions**

   * In cases where the assistant cannot handle a request, use the actions section to define clear, polite, and professional handoff messages or instructions for sending additional information via SMS.

### Notes on global rules and structure

* **Global rules**: Use global rules to establish consistent behaviors for your assistant, such as tone, response length, or instructions to defer certain questions.

* **Structured examples**: Example queries and responses are essential for guiding the model toward providing accurate and on-brand answers.

* **Test and refine**: Continuously test and refine the knowledge base by observing how the assistant performs in real scenarios.
