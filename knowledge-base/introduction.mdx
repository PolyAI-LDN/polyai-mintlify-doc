title: "Managed Topics Overview"
---

The Managed Topics (MTs) are the brain of your agent. Each topic defines a single intent — how users might phrase it, what the agent should say, and what it should do next.

Well-structured entries keep answers clear, safe, and meaningful.

## How retrieval works

![retrieval](/images/kb-rag-ven.png)

The agent **does not** see all MTs at once. Instead, it uses [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction) to find the best match for the user’s message.

1. The retriever compares the message to the topic’s **name**, **sample questions**, and **content** — with higher weighting given to the name and sample questions.
2. It returns the top few matching topics.
3. The model selects one and generates a reply (and may trigger an **action**, **function**, or **flow transition**).

## Types of MTs entries

Below are the broad categories that most MTs entries tend to fall into.

### Simple FAQ

Used when the agent just needs to answer a question with no follow-up or action required.

#### Single turn

One message in, one message out.

- Add a short, helpful reply in `content`.
- Leave `actions` empty.

#### Multi turn

Ask a clarifying question before giving the answer.

- Use branching inside `content` to structure the reply.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Pet policy (multi-turn)** <img src="/images/kb-multi.png" alt="multi-pet_policy" />

### Handoff

Used when the agent should offer to connect the user to a human agent.

#### Offer

Agent replies, then offers to transfer.

- `content`: Include the answer and the offer.
- `actions`: Trigger `transfer_call` (or another handoff function) only if the user accepts.

**Example – Spa booking** <img src="/images/kb-handoff-spa.png" alt="handoff_offer-spa" />

#### Direct

Immediate transfer with no agent reply.

- Leave `content` empty.
- Always run `transfer_call` in `actions`.

**Example – Billing handoff** <img src="/images/kb-direct-billing.png" alt="handoff-direct-billing" />

#### Conditional

Transfer based on user clarification — for example, group size or request type.

- `content`: Ask a disambiguating question.
- `actions`: Map each answer to the correct destination.

**Example – Room reservations** <img src="/images/kb-handoff-conditional.png" alt="handoff_conditional-room_reservation" />

### Outbound messaging

Used when you want to follow up with a link or information by text or chat (SMS or WhatsApp).

#### Offer

Offer to send a link via message.

- `content`: Include a short message and ask for consent.
- `actions`: If accepted, call `start_sms_flow`.

**Example – Golf info** <img src="/images/kb-handoff-sms.png" alt="SMS_offer-golf" />

#### Conditional

Let the user choose which message to receive.

- `content`: Ask a branching question.
- `actions`: Map answers to different `sms_id`s.

**Example – Tee time booking** <img src="/images/kb-sms-conditional.png" alt="SMS_conditional-golf_booking" />

### Info only

Used for static reference material (like opening hours or prices). No interaction or action required.

- Fill `content`.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Opening hours** <img src="/images/kb-misc-info.png" alt="misc_info_dump_opening_hours" />

## Best practices

**Do this:**

- Use specific topic names.
- Add 5–10 realistic sample phrasings.
- Keep replies short, helpful, and on-brand.
- Use `actions` only when necessary.
- Split multi-part flows into separate turns or topics.

**Avoid this:**

- Bundling multiple intents into one topic.
- Running more than one action per turn.
- Using vague topic names like `Misc`, `Help`, or `Info`.

## Activating and deactivating topics

Not every topic needs to be available all the time. You can temporarily **deactivate** a topic to keep it out of retrieval without deleting it or removing its content.

- Inactive topics are **ignored by the LLM** and marked clearly in the UI.
- Activation status is **environment-specific**, so you can test changes safely in Sandbox before going live.
- CSV import/export includes an `Active` column (`Y`/`N`) for bulk updates.

This is useful for seasonal articles, phased rollouts, A/B tests, or hiding content that is not ready for production.
