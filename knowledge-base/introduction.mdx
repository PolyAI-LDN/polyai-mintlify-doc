The **knowledge base** is the backbone of your agent's configuration. It organizes topics and interactions that guide responses to user queries. Each topic typically represents a single FAQ or use case and contains three key parts:

1. **Topic name**: A concise, descriptive title summarizing the topic.
2. **Content**: The main information, including sample queries and model answers.
3. [**Actions**](./how-to-setup-action/introduction): Follow-up workflows triggered by the topic, like sending [SMS](/sms/introduction) messages or handing off to a live agent.

A well-structured knowledge base ensures your agent retrieves accurate information, performs tasks reliably, and delivers a consistent user experience.

## Key components of a topic

### Topic name
- **Clarity and precision**: Use clear, descriptive titles such as *"Opening Hours"* or *"Refund Policy"* that reflect the topic's content.
- **Analytics impact**: Topic names influence search accuracy, dashboard analytics, and reporting.
- **Best practice**: Avoid generic or overly broad names that can lead to misretrieval.

### Sample questions

- Sample questions help the model determine when to use this topic.
- **Include at least 5 phrased variations** per topic to boost retrieval reliability and reduce fallback errors.

<Note>
If a topic has too few or overly narrow examples, the model may skip it — even if the content matches. This often leads to fallback responses like *"I don’t have information about that."*
</Note>

**Example (for "Refund Policy"):**
- "Can I get my money back?"
- "How do I request a refund?"
- "What’s your return policy?"

### Content section
- **Core information**: Add concise, actionable content that directly addresses user questions. Write in the tone you expect the agent to use.
- **Organize large topics**: Break down complex topics into logical, smaller sections to ensure clarity and precision.

### Actions section
The Actions section allows the agent to perform workflows beyond delivering answers.

- **Common actions**:
  - Sending [SMS messages](/sms/introduction).
  - Triggering a [handoff to a live agent](/call-handoff/introduction).
  - Invoking custom [functions](/function/introduction) (e.g., fetching live data).

- **Structured instructions**: Clearly define what should happen when a topic is triggered.
  - *Example*:
    `"If the user asks for emergency assistance, trigger a handoff to a live agent in the support queue."`

## Best practices for building a knowledge base

### Write clear, actionable content
- Use direct language that’s easy for users to understand.
- Keep content concise and avoid ambiguity.

### Add diverse sample questions
- Include 5–10 different phrasings of common user queries per topic.
- These help clarify the scope of the topic for the model.

### Simplify and structure topics
- Group related questions under a single topic if they share similar context or answers.
- Avoid overloading a single topic with too many unrelated intents.

### Plan for risky or critical scenarios
- Identify high-risk or regulated topics (e.g., refunds, complaints, emergencies).
- Add specific instructions or actions to ensure they’re handled clearly and consistently.

### Define and test actions
- Use the **Actions** field to link workflows like SMS notifications, function calls, or handoffs.
- Test actions thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected in real scenarios.

## Global rules and tone

Use [global rules](/agent-settings/rules) to set overall tone and behavior across all topics.

**Example:**
- Rule: "Respond in a friendly, concise tone. Avoid long explanations or unnecessary repetition."

## Iterate and improve

- Monitor conversations and continuously update your KB based on real examples.
- Add new sample questions to underperforming topics.
- Refine unclear content or missed actions to improve response accuracy.

By following these best practices, you'll create a knowledge base that’s accurate, reliable, and easy to scale.
