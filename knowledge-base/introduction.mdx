The knowledge base (KB) is the brain of your agent. Each topic defines a single intent, how users might phrase it, what the agent should say, and what it should do next.

Well-structured entries keep answers clear, safe, and meaningful.

## How retrieval works

The agent **does not** see the whole knowledge base every time. Instead, it uses [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction) to find the best match for the user's message.

1. The retriever compares the user's message to the **name**, **sample questions**, and **content**.
2. It returns the closest few topics.
3. The model selects one and generates a reply (and may trigger an **action**).

## Types of knowledge base entries

We will now go through the broad categories that most knowledge base entries tend to fall into:

### Simple FAQ

Used when the agent just needs to answer a question with no follow-up or action required.

#### Single turn

One message in, one message out.

- Add a short, helpful reply in `content`.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Pet policy (single-turn)**
![simple_FAQ_single_turn-pet_policy](/images/kb-single-turn-pet-policy.png)

#### Multi turn

Ask a clarifying question before giving the answer.

- Use branching inside `content` to structure the reply.
- Leave `actions` empty.

**Example – Pet policy (multi-turn)**

### Handoff

Used when the agent should offer to connect the user to a human agent.

#### Offer

Agent replies, then offers to transfer.

- `content`: Include the answer + offer.
- `actions`: Trigger `transfer_call` only if user accepts.

**Example – Spa booking**
![handoff_offer-spa](/images/kb-handoff-spa.png)

#### Direct

Immediate transfer with no agent reply.

- Leave `content` empty.
- Always run `transfer_call` in `actions`.

**Example – Billing handoff**

#### Conditional

Transfer based on user clarification, for example, group size, request type.

- `content`: Ask a disambiguating question.
- `actions`: Map each answer to the correct destination.

**Example – Room reservations**

### SMS

Used when you want to follow up with a link or info through text.

#### Offer

Offer to send a link by SMS.

- `content`: Include a short message and ask for consent.
- `actions`: If accepted, call `start_sms_flow`.

**Example – Golf info**
![SMS_offer-golf](/images/kb-sms-golf.png)

#### Conditional

Let the user choose which SMS to receive.

- `content`: Ask a branching question.
- `actions`: Map answers to different `sms_id`s.

**Example – Tee time booking**
![SMS_conditional-golf_booking](/images/kb-sms-conditional-golf-booking.png)

### SMS + handoff combo

Used when you want to **try sending a text**, and if that fails, **offer to transfer** instead.

- `content`: Offer SMS, with a polite fallback.
- `actions`: Include both SMS and optional transfer logic.

**Example – Concierge activities**
![sms-conditional](/images/kb-sms-conditional.png)

### Info only

Used for reference material (like opening hours or prices). No interaction or action required.

- Fill `content`
- Leave `actions` empty

**Example – Opening hours**

## Best practices

Do this:
- Use specific topic names
- Add 5–10 realistic sample phrasings
- Keep replies short, helpful, and on-brand
- Use `actions` only when necessary
- Split multi-part flows into separate turns or topics

Avoid this:
- Bundling multiple intents into one topic
- Running more than one action per turn
- Using vague topic names like `Misc`, `Help`, or `Info`
