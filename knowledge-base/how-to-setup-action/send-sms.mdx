2. **Right-Click in the Knowledge Base Card's "Actions" Field**
3. **Click the Add Icon on the Right Side of the "Actions" Box**

## Selecting the SMS Template

After performing one of the actions above, you will see the "SMS" option. Follow these steps:

1. **Find the "SMS" Option**
   - Look for "SMS" in the menu that appears.

2. **Select an Existing SMS Template**
   - You will see a list of existing SMS templates you have created. Select the one you want to send out.

3. **Create a New SMS Template (Optional)**
   - If you need a new template, click "+ add sms template" to create an empty SMS template placeholder. You can fill in the details later in the SMS tab.

## Completing the Action

Click the SMS template that you would like to send out to complete the action.

## Example Prompt

Hereâ€™s an example of how to construct a prompt for your voice assistant to send an SMS:
