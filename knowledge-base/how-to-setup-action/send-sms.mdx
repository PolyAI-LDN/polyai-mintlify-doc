Integrating SMS sending functionality into your knowledge base allows your voice assistant to send SMS messages based on user interactions. Before enabling outbound SMS, please ensure that you have completed the setup process described in the [How to Setup SMS Integration](/telephony/twilio-how-to-integrate-sms) page.

## Adding an SMS trigger to the knowledge base

You can add "trigger sending out SMS" into the knowledge base in three ways:

1. **Type "/" in the card's "Actions" field**
2. **Right-click in the card's "Actions" field**
3. **Click the **+** icon on the right side of the field**

## Selecting the SMS template

After performing one of the actions above, you will see the "SMS" option. Follow these steps:

1. **Find the "SMS" option**
   - Look for "SMS" in the menu that appears.

2. **Select an existing SMS template**
   - You will see a list of existing SMS templates you have created. Select the one you want to send out.

3. **Create a new SMS template (Optional)**
   - If you need a new template, click "+ add sms template" to create an empty SMS template placeholder. You can fill in the details later in the SMS tab.

## Completing the action

Click the SMS template that you would like to send out to complete the action.

## Example prompt

Here's an example of how to construct a prompt for your voice assistant to send an SMS:

```plaintext
After the caller confirms that they would like to receive an SMS message with further details, call {{SMS_template}} to send the SMS out.
```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate SMS sending capabilities into your knowledge base actions. This allows your voice assistant to provide additional information via SMS, enhancing the overall user experience.
