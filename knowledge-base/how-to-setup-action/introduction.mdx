**Actions** tell your agent what to do when it retrieves a specific knowledge base topic. They can send [SMS messages](./send-sms), run [custom functions](./function-call), or transfer users to a [live agent](./handoff).

<Tip> You can leave the actions field blank. </Tip>

## What are actions?

Actions expand your agent's capabilities, allowing it to:

- **Send SMS messages**: Share confirmations, links, or follow-up details.
- **Run custom functions**: Perform advanced tasks like fetching real-time data or interacting with external systems.
- **Trigger handoffs**: Seamlessly connect users to live agents for complex issues.

Actions make your agent dynamic and better equipped to handle real-world scenarios.

## Adding actions to the knowledge base

### How to add actions
Actions are configured in the **Actions field** of a knowledge base topic. You can add them in three ways:

1. **Type `/`**: Opens a command palette to select the desired action.
2. **Right-click**: Shows a menu of available actions.
3. **Click the `+` icon**: Use the dropdown menu to add an action like sending SMS, invoking a function, or triggering a handoff.

### Example: Adding an SMS action
1. Open a topic in the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) like *Store Hours*.
2. Go to the **Actions field** and type `/send-sms`.
3. Choose a SMS template.
4. Configure the trigger to send the SMS when the topic is matched.

## Common actions and use cases

### Sending SMS
Use SMS actions to share essential details directly with users.

**Example**:
A user asks for refund instructions. The agent sends an SMS with a link to the refund portal.

**Configuration**:
- **Action**: *Send SMS*
- **Trigger**: *User queries refund process*
- **SMS Template**: *RefundPolicyTemplate*

### Invoking functions
Functions allow the agent to perform advanced tasks, such as retrieving external data or performing calculations.

**Example**:
A user asks for the weather forecast. The agent runs a function to fetch the current weather details.

**Configuration**:
- **Action**: *Invoke Function*
- **Function**: *getWeatherForecast*
- **Trigger**: *User queries weather details*

### Triggering handoffs
Use handoff actions to transfer users to live agents when they need human support.

**Example**:
A user mentions a billing dispute. The agent connects them to the billing department.

**Configuration**:
- **Action**: *Trigger Handoff*
- **Destination**: *Billing Queue*
- **Trigger**: *User mentions billing*

## Best practices for actions

1. **Use precise triggers**
   - Clearly define conditions for actions to avoid false triggers.
   - Example: Use specific phrases like *User mentions refund* instead of broad keywords.

2. **Write concise SMS templates**
   - Keep messages short, professional, and easy to understand.
   - Example: "Your refund request is being processed. Visit [this link] for details."

3. **Test custom functions thoroughly**
   - Validate function performance across different user scenarios.
   - Add fallback actions to handle potential errors.

4. **Plan handoff workflows**
   - Use polite, clear messages to inform users before transferring them.
   - Example: "Let me connect you to a billing specialist who can help further."

5. **Combine actions for complex workflows**
   - Chain multiple actions for advanced tasks.
   - Example: Fetch booking details using a function and send the information with SMS.
