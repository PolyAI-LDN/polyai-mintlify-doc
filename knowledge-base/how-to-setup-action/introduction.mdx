**Actions** define how your assistant responds to specific knowledge base topics. They enable tasks such as sending SMS messages, invoking [custom functions](/functions/introduction), and triggering [call handoffs](/call-handoff/introduction) to a live agent.

---

## What are Actions?

Actions extend the capabilities of your assistant by enabling it to perform tasks beyond answering questions. These tasks include:

- **Sending SMS messages**: Useful for sharing additional information or confirmations.
- **Invoking custom functions**: Ideal for complex operations like accessing external APIs or performing calculations.
- **Triggering call handoffs**: Seamless transitions to live agents when required.

Actions ensure the assistant can address diverse scenarios and provide users with comprehensive support.

## Adding Actions to the Knowledge Base

### How to Add Actions
Actions are tied to knowledge base topics and can be added via the **"Actions" field**. There are three ways to configure actions:

1. **Type `/` in the "Actions" field**: Opens a command palette for selecting actions.
2. **Right-click in the "Actions" field**: Access a context menu to choose the desired action.
3. **Click the **+** icon**: Use the dropdown menu to add actions like sending SMS, invoking functions, or triggering handoffs.

### Example: Adding an SMS Action
- Go to a topic in your knowledge base (e.g., "Store Hours").
- Open the "Actions" field and type `/send-sms`.
- Select the desired SMS template (e.g., *StoreHoursTemplate*).
- Configure the action to trigger when the topic is retrieved.

- SMS Template: *RefundPolicyTemplate*

**Configuration:**
- Action: Invoke Function
- Function: *getWeatherForecast*
- Trigger: *User queries weather details.*

### Triggering Handoff
**Use case:** Transfer users to a human agent for complex issues.

**Configuration:**
- Action: Trigger Handoff

## Best Practices for Configuring Actions

1. **Use Specific Triggers**
   - Clearly define conditions for each action to ensure accuracy.
   - Example: Use triggers like *User mentions refund* rather than vague criteria.

2. **Structure SMS Templates Thoughtfully**
   - Ensure SMS messages are concise, relevant, and professional.
   - Use predefined templates for consistency.

3. **Test Custom Functions in Production-Like Environments**
   - Validate that functions perform as expected across different user scenarios.
   - Check for failure points and add error handling where necessary.

4. **Plan for Handoff Scenarios**
   - Provide clear, polite instructions to users before transferring them.
   - Example: "Iâ€™ll connect you to an agent who can assist further."

5. **Combine Actions for Complex Workflows**
   - Chain multiple actions together where needed (e.g., invoke a function and then send an SMS based on the result).
   - Example: Fetch appointment details and send them via SMS.
