Integrating handoff functionality into your knowledge base allows your voice assistant to transfer calls to a human agent based on user interactions. Here’s how you can set this up:

## Adding Handoff Trigger to Knowledge Base

You can add "trigger handoff" into the knowledge base in three ways:

1. **Type "/" in the card's "Actions" field**
2. **Right-click in the card's "Actions" field**
3. **Click the **+** icon on the right side of the field**

## Selecting the Handoff Destination

After performing one of the actions above, you will see the "Call handoff" option. Follow these steps:

1. **Find the "Call Handoff" Option**
   - Look for "Call handoff" in the menu that appears.

2. **Select an Existing Handoff Destination**
   - You will see a list of existing handoff destinations you have created. Select the one you want to use.

3. **Create a New Handoff Destination (Optional)**
   - If you need a new destination, click "+ Add handoff" to create a new handoff destination. You can fill in the details as required.

## Completing the Action

Choose the right handoff destination to complete the action.

## Example Prompt

Here’s an example of how to construct a prompt for your voice assistant to trigger a handoff:

```plaintext
After the caller says they would like to be handed off to an agent, call {{handoff_destination}} to transfer the call to an agent.
```


By following these steps, you can effectively integrate handoff capabilities into your knowledge base actions. This allows your voice assistant to seamlessly transfer calls to human agents when necessary, enhancing the overall user experience.
