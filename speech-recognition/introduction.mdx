<Tab title="Keyphrase Boosting">

## Overview

PolyAI uses advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models to convert spoken language into written text. To improve the
recognition of critical domain-specific terms, use the Keyphrase Boosting feature.

### Key benefits

- **Improved SLU accuracy**: Increases the likelihood of accurately recognizing critical terms.
- **Domain adaptability**: Ensures the agent recognizes industry-specific terminology.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Reduces misunderstandings and errors, leading to more effective interactions.
- **Easy management**: Manage and update keyphrases in the UI.

### How it works

Keyphrase Boosting biases the ASR model toward recognizing specific words and phrases. By curating a list of keyphrases relevant to your domain, you can improve transcription accuracy for those terms, resulting in better inputs for the Language Learning Model (LLM) and improved agent performance.

### Getting started

#### Configuring Keyphrase Boosting

1. **Access the Speech Recognition page**: Navigate to the **[Speech Recognition section](/speech-recognition/introduction)**.
2. **Manage keyphrases**:
   - In the **Keyphrase Boosting** tab, add, edit, or remove keyphrases.
   - Use the **Keyphrase** column to input domain-specific terms.
3. **Set bias strength**:
   - Adjust the bias strength for each keyphrase using the slider.
   - Options range from **Default** (moderate priority) to **Maximum** (high priority).
4. **Save changes**: Once configured, the updated keyphrases will be applied immediately to improve ASR recognition.

#### Bias strength configuration

- **Default**: Balances recognition accuracy with overall ASR performance.
- **Maximum**: Prioritizes keyphrases for improved accuracy but may impact general performance.

**Important**: When both global and local biasing are applied, local settings take precedence.

<Tab title="Transcript Corrections">

## Overview

Accurate transcription is vital for effective agent responses, particularly in specialized industries like healthcare, legal, and technical support. The Transcript Corrections feature enables custom string corrections to ensure domain-specific terms and misheard phrases are accurately transcribed, enhancing the quality of inputs for the LLM.

### Key benefits

- **Improved accuracy**: Correct common ASR misinterpretations.
- **Domain-specific customization**: Tailor corrections for unique terminology.
- **Streamlined workflow**: Configure corrections directly in the PolyAI UI.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Ensure precise transcription for reliable interactions.
- **Efficient LLM inputs**: Deliver cleaner text for improved response quality.

### How it works

Transcript Corrections use string matching and regex patterns to manage misinterpretations. When a match is detected:
- The system replaces the incorrect word or phrase with the specified correction.
- Corrections can be applied to the entire transcript or specific portions.

### Getting started

#### Configuring Transcript Corrections

1. **Access the Speech Recognition page**: Go to the **[Speech Recognition section](/speech-recognition/introduction)**.
2. **Open the Transcript Corrections tab**: From here, you can create, edit, or delete correction rules.
3. **Create a new correction**:
   - Click **Add Correction** to open the creation form.
   - Define the correction:
     - **Regex**: Specify the regular expression to identify the misinterpreted phrase.
     - **Replacement**: Enter the correct term or phrase.
     - **Replacement type**:
       - **Full transcript**: Replaces the entire transcript if matched exactly.
       - **Partial transcript**: Replaces only the matching portion.
4. **Save changes**: Apply your corrections immediately.

#### Example configuration

| Attribute          | Value                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **ID**             | `stop_inappropriate`                        |
| **Regex**          | `/\\b(offensiveWord1\|offensiveWord2)\\b/i` |
| **Replacement**    | `[Correct term or phrase]`                  |
| **Replacement type** | Partial transcript                        |

This setup ensures phrases like "offensiveWord1" are replaced, maintaining accuracy and professionalism.

## Diacritics

If your agent is operating in a language that uses [diacritics](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/misc/diacritics) — such as **č, ć, š, ž, đ**.

These characters are common in languages like **Croatian**, **Serbian**, **Bosnian**, **Slovak**, **Czech**, **Slovenian**, and others. Some ASR models can misinterpret these letters, reducing accuracy for names and other proper nouns.
