PolyAI offers webchat as a chat **Channel**, alongside voice. You can configure the chat widget in any existing project in the **Settings** tab.

## Styling

Use the live preview in the **Styling** tab to adjust how the widget looks.
The preview on the right updates immediately as you change settings.

- **Header text**: The title shown in the widget header. Use your brand or assistant name.
- **Primary color**: Sets header and action elements. Enter a hex code or pick from the selector. [Aim for sufficient contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

- Left panel: editable fields for **Header text** and **Primary color**.
- Right panel: a real-time preview of the widget with your changes applied.

## Content

The **Content** tab controls what users see before a session begins.
You can display disclaimers, collect consent, and add a link to your company’s privacy and terms & conditions pages.

### Disclaimers

Provide a message that explains how chats are recorded and processed.
Use this to meet data-handling or legal transparency requirements.

- **Field:** *Disclaimer message*
  Example:
  > This is an AI-powered system and responses should be verified. All chats are recorded in order to respond to your query and for training and quality control purposes.

- **Toggle:** *Enable "I consent and start chat" button*
  When enabled, users must click the consent button before they can begin chatting.
  The label text cannot currently be edited.
  When disabled, the disclaimer simply displays automatically.

- **Reset to default:** Restores the original disclaimer message.

### Company policies

Add clickable links to your Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions.
These appear below the consent button in smaller text.

- **Fields:**
  - *Privacy policy URL (optional)* — `https://example.com/privacy-policy`
  - *Terms & conditions URL (optional)* — `https://example.com/terms-conditions`

## Test and install

There are two ways to test and deploy the widget:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Live test">

  Use **Preview Demo** to test directly inside the Studio without embedding anything.

  - Click **Preview Demo** to open the chat in an inline iFrame.
  - Interact with the widget to verify greetings, styling, and consent flow.
  - The floating launcher (bottom-right) opens and closes the chat window.

  ![Preview Demo panel](/images/webchat/preview-test-panel.png)

  The left side shows the "Preview Demo" button under "Test and install," and the right preview reflects your current **Header text** and **Primary color**.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Embedded script">

  Generate a script tag to embed the widget on your website.

  - Choose an [environment](/environments-and-versions/introduction): **Sandbox**, **Pre-release**, or **Live**. This controls where conversations are logged.
  - Enter your **Website URL**.
  - Click **Generate script tag**, then copy and paste it before the closing `</body>` tag on your site.
  - If you update your settings later in **Customize** or **Content**, you will have to regenerate and redeploy the tag.

  ![Script tag generation panel](/images/webchat/script-tag.png)

  Environment tabs appear across the top, the website URL field below, and a generated script ready to copy.

  <script src="https://webchat.us-1.polyai.app/widget/R-ZBJo0n4qQJU0Qt_aRFi0D6MzRySlrmS7fJYTTXh1I.js"></script>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
![Variant dropdown](/images/webchat/variant-dropdown.png)

Use the **variant dropdown** in the top-right of the preview to select which [variant](/variant-management/introduction) the webchat connects to. Both **Preview Demo** and the **generated script tag** reflect the variant you select.
