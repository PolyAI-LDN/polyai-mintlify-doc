PolyAI offers webchat as an additional **Channel** alongside voice. You can configure the widget in any existing project under **Settings → Webchat**.

<Note>
Conversations from webchat appear in [Conversation review](/call-data/studio-transcripts) with **Channel: Webchat**.
</Note>

## Customize

Use the live preview in the **Customize** tab to adjust how the widget looks. The preview on the right updates immediately as you change settings.

- **Header text**: The title shown in the widget header. Use your brand or assistant name.
- **Primary color**: Sets header and action elements (buttons, chips). Enter a hex code or pick from the selector. Aim for sufficient contrast.

- Left panel: editable fields for the **Header text** and **Primary color**.
- Right panel: a real-time preview of the widget with your changes applied.
- Info banner: after changing styles, you must deploy via **Test and install → Generate script tag**.

## Test and install

There are two ways to test the widget:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Live test">
  Use **Preview Demo** for an in-page test without touching your website.

  - Click **Preview Demo** to load the widget in an inline iFrame.
  - Interact with the chat to validate greetings, handoff, and styling.
  - The floating launcher button (bottom-right) opens/closes the widget. The demo uses the settings from **Customize** and the variant selected in the dropdown.

  **What the screenshots show:**

  ![Preview Demo panel](/images/webchat/preview-test-panel.png)

  - The **Preview Demo** section is at the top of **Test and install**.
  - The right-hand panel shows the widget rendered with your current Header text and Primary color.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Embedded script">
  Generate a script tag to add the widget to your website.

  - Choose the [environment](/environments-and-versions/introduction): **Sandbox**, **Pre-release**, or **Live**. This decides where conversations are sent.
  - Enter your **Website URL**. This ties the tag to the site you’re deploying on.
  - Select **Generate script tag**, then copy the tag and paste it into your site HTML before `</body>`.
  - If you later change styles in **Customize**, generate a new tag and redeploy so your site picks up the latest look.

  **What the screenshot shows:**

  ![Script tag generation](/images/webchat/script-tag.png)

  - **Environment** is set to **Live**.
  - A site URL has been entered and the script tag is generated and ready to copy.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
![Variant dropdown](/images/webchat/variant-dropdown.png)

Use the **variant dropdown** in the top-right of the preview to choose which [variant](/variant-management/introduction) the webchat connects to. Both **Preview Demo** and the **generated script tag** reflect the variant you select.
