title: 'Example flow'
description: Use this reservation confirmation flow as an example.
---

<Tip>You can copy full or partial flows between projects using `Cmd/Ctrl + C` and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` in the Flow Editor.</Tip>

## Overview

This flow handles a real-world reservation confirmation scenario. It highlights:
- Step-specific prompts and function references
- ASR biasing for input accuracy
- Clean state transitions between flow steps

<Tabs>

<Tab title="A. Flow name (breadcrumb)">
The flow name appears at the top of the editor and identifies the current flow ‚Äî in this case, `reservation confirmation`.

It also acts as a **breadcrumb**, allowing you to return to the list of all flows. This is useful when working across multiple projects or assistants.
</Tab>

<Tab title="B. Step name and icon">
This shows the **current step**: `Collect confirmation code`. The üèÅ icon indicates it's the **start step** of the flow.

Each step contains:
- A prompt shown to the user
- A set of visible functions the LLM can call
- Transition logic to guide conversation flow
</Tab>

<Tab title="C. Inline function reference">
Inside the step prompt, the LLM is told to call `save_confirmation_code` if the user provides a valid input.

```python
def save_confirmation_code(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, confirmation: str):
    conv.state.confirmation_code = confirmation
    flow.goto_step("Collect first name")
    return
```

Inline functions are inserted using `/` and appear as underlined blocks in the prompt editor.
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tabs>

<Tab title="D. Add another reference">
Clicking the ‚ûï icon below the prompt lets you:
- Add another function reference
- Insert a transition to another step
- Reference rules or knowledge base topics

This is useful for branching logic but avoid chaining multiple `goto_step()` calls inside a single function. Always `return` after calling `goto_step`.
</Tab>

<Tab title="E. ASR biasing">
This step has [ASR biasing](asr-biasing) set to **Alphanumeric**, improving recognition of spoken confirmation codes like ‚ÄúB‚Äì4‚ÄìZ‚ÄìQ‚Äì9‚Äù.

You can enable other biasing types as needed, including:
- Name spelling
- Time and date
- Numbers
- Addresses
</Tab>

<Tab title="F. Flow toolbar (bottom panel)">
At the bottom of the Flow Editor:
- **Flow functions** opens a modal to manage logic used in the flow
- **+ Step** adds a new node to the flow canvas

Transition functions created here are scoped to the flow unless declared globally.
</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Reminders

- LLMs only see the **current step's prompt and function list** ‚Äî not previous steps
- Always use `return` after `flow.goto_step()` to prevent silent overrides
- Avoid naming transitions by position (`goto_step_4`) ‚Äî use intent-based names like `match_reservation` or `retry_lookup`

Let me know if you'd like this paired with an actual `.flow.json` export or embedded in your onboarding docs.
