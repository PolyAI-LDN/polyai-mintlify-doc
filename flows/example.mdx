description: Use this reservation confirmation flow as an example.

<Tip>You can copy full or partial flows between projects using `Cmd/Ctrl + C` and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` in the Flow Editor.</Tip>

This flow handles a real-world reservation confirmation scenario. It highlights:
- Step-specific prompts and function references
- ASR biasing for input accuracy
- Clean state transitions between flow steps

![example-1](/images/flow-hotel-start-step.png)

## A. Flow name (breadcrumb)
The flow name appears at the top of the editor and identifies the current flow — in this case, `reservation confirmation`.

It also acts as a **breadcrumb**, allowing you to return to the list of all flows. This is useful when working across multiple projects or assistants.

## B. Step name and icon
This shows the **current step**: `Collect confirmation code`. The 🏁 icon indicates it's the **start step** of the flow.

Each step contains:
- A prompt shown to the user
- Transition logic to guide conversation flow
- A set of visible functions the LLM can call.

## C. Transition function reference
Inside the step prompt, the LLM is told to call `save_confirmation_code` if the user provides a valid input.

This example uses both the [conversation](/function/classes/conv-object) and [flow](/flows/object) objects:

```python
def save_confirmation_code(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, confirmation: str):
    conv.state.confirmation_code = confirmation
    flow.goto_step("Collect first name")
    return
```

Transition functions are inserted using `/` and appear as underlined blocks in the prompt editor.

See the [transition function](transition-functions) page for more details.

## D. Add another reference
Clicking the <Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" />. icon below the prompt lets you:
- Add another function reference
- Insert a transition to another step
- Reference rules or knowledge base topics

This is useful for branching logic but avoid chaining multiple `goto_step()` calls inside a single function. Always `return` after calling `goto_step`.

## E. ASR biasing
This step has [ASR biasing](asr-biasing) set to **Alphanumeric**, improving recognition of spoken confirmation codes like "B–4–Z–Q–9".

You can enable other biasing types as needed, including:
- Name spelling
- Time and date
- Numbers
- Addresses

See the [ASR biasing](asr-biasing) page for more details.

## F. Flow toolbar (bottom panel)
At the bottom of the Flow Editor:
- **Flow functions** opens a modal to manage logic used in the flow
- **+ Step** adds a new node to the flow canvas

Transition functions created here are scoped to the flow unless declared globally.

## Reminders

- LLMs only see the **current step's prompt and function list** — not previous steps
- Always use `return` after `flow.goto_step()` to prevent silent overrides
- Avoid naming transitions by position (`goto_step_4`) — use intent-based names like `match_reservation` or `retry_lookup`
