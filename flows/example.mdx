<Tip> Full or partial flows can be easily copied between projects using `Cmd/Ctrl + C` and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` </Tip>

Here's an example of a flow for making a restaurant reservation:

1. **Start step**: Collect the date, time, and number of people.
   - Prompt: "What date and time would you like to book a table for? How many people will be dining?"
   - Function: `CollectReservationDetails`

2. **Check availability**:
   - Call an API to check availability based on user input.
   - If available: Transition to the confirmation step.
   - If unavailable: Prompt the user to choose a different time.

3. **Confirmation step**:
   - Prompt: "Great! Your table is booked for [date] at [time] for [number of people]. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
   - Function: `ExitFlow`

## Connecting steps

You can connect flow steps from the **prompt** field:

 1. Type "/" in the prompt field.
 2. Scroll down until you find **Steps**.
 3. You will see a searchable and scrollable list of all the current flow steps. Select one to create a flow function.
 4. Name your transition flow function, or retain the autogenerated name.in
