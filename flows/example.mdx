<Tip>You can copy full or partial flows between projects using `Cmd/Ctrl + C` and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` in the Flow Editor.</Tip>

This flow handles a real-world reservation confirmation scenario. It highlights:
- Step-specific prompts and function references
- ASR biasing for input accuracy
- Clean state transitions between flow steps

## Start step

To help identify some of the key parts of a flow step, the start step is annotated. Click a lettered heading to go to the relevant section.

![example-1](/images/flow-hotel-start-step.png)

### A. Flow name (breadcrumb)
The flow name appears at the top of the editor and identifies the current flow ‚Äî in this case, `reservation confirmation`.

It also acts as a **breadcrumb**, allowing you to return to the list of all flows. This is useful when working across multiple projects or agents.

### B. Step name and icon
This shows the **current step**: `Collect confirmation code`. The üèÅ icon indicates it's the **start step** of the flow.

Each step contains:
- A prompt shown to the user
- Transition logic to guide conversation flow
- A set of visible functions the LLM can call.

### C. Transition function reference
Inside the step prompt, the LLM is told to call `save_confirmation_code` if the user provides a valid input.

This example uses both the [conversation](/function/classes/conv-object) and [flow](./object) objects:

```python
def save_confirmation_code(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, confirmation: str):
    conv.state.confirmation_code = confirmation
    flow.goto_step("Collect first name")
    return
```

Transition functions are inserted using `/` and appear as underlined blocks in the prompt editor.

See the [transition function](./transition-functions) page for more details.

### D. Add another reference
Clicking the <Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" />. icon below the prompt lets you:
- Add another function reference
- Insert a transition to another step
- Reference rules or knowledge base topics

This is useful for branching logic but avoid chaining multiple `goto_step()` calls inside a single function. Always `return` after calling `goto_step`.

### E. ASR biasing
This step has [ASR biasing](./asr-biasing) set to **Alphanumeric**, improving recognition of spoken confirmation codes like "B‚Äì4‚ÄìZ‚ÄìQ‚Äì9".

You can enable other biasing types as needed, including:
- Name spelling
- Time and date
- Numbers
- Addresses

See the [ASR biasing](./asr-biasing) page for more details.

### F. Flow toolbar (bottom panel)
At the bottom of the Flow Editor:
- **Flow functions** opens a modal to manage logic used in the flow
- **+ Step** adds a new node to the flow canvas

Transition functions created here are scoped to the flow unless declared globally.

## Middle steps

![example-2](/images/flow-example-middle.png)

The agent collects the user‚Äôs **first** and **last** name using separate steps, each with its own prompt and transition logic.

- If the user has already provided the name, the agent calls the relevant function (e.g. `save_first_name`, `save_last_name`) and proceeds.
- If not, the agent asks for it directly.

Each step uses **few-shot prompting** to improve recognition of tricky formats:

```plaintext
User: It‚Äôs Smith.
Johannes: Thanks ‚Äî that‚Äôs Smith.

User: My surname is de la Cruz.
Johannes: Got it, de la Cruz.

User: Sure, that‚Äôs H-O-W-E. Howe.
Johannes: Thanks for spelling it ‚Äî I‚Äôve got Howe.
```

[ASR biasing](./asr-biasing) is set to **Name spelling** in the "Collect last name" step to improve recognition of spelled-out inputs.

## End step

![example-3](/images/flow-example-end.png)

The agent attempts to match the user's provided details against active reservations.

- It compares the `confirmation code`, `first name`, and `last name` against entries in the `$reservations` list.
- If a match is found, it calls the `confirm_reservation` function and moves forward.
- If no match is found, it calls `transfer_call` with the following parameters:
  - `destination="RESERVATIONS"`
  - `reason="RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND"`
  - `utterance="Right, let me put you through to someone who can help. Just a moment."`

This is a standard validation step using dynamic values and conditional logic.

## Reminders

- LLMs only see the **current step's prompt and function list** ‚Äî not previous steps
- Always use `return` after `flow.goto_step()` to prevent silent overrides
- Avoid naming transitions by position (`goto_step_4`) ‚Äî use intent-based names like `match_reservation` or `retry_lookup`
