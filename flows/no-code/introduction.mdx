**No-code Flows** let you build conversational workflows visually — using prompts, entity extraction, and clear branching — without writing any [code](/flows/introduction) or [transition functions](/flows/transition-functions).

1. Understand what the caller wants (intent)
2. Collect key details (entities)
3. Decide what happens next (conditions)
4. Optionally call an API (using a Function step, if enabled)
5. End cleanly or hand off (exit flows)

## Key concepts (in plain terms)

- **Step (node):** A box. It represents one moment in the conversation (ask something, confirm something, collect details).
- **Edge:** A line between steps. It represents a possible next path.
- **Condition:** A label on an edge that explains *when* that edge should be taken.
- **Entity:** A piece of structured information you want to collect (phone number, date, address).
- **Exit flow:** A terminal end point (finish, handoff, stop).

## Step types

### Default step (no-code)
Use Default steps for most of your flow:
- Write natural-language instructions (prompt)
- Extract entities
- Branch to other steps using edges + conditions

### Function step (low-code, still visual)
Use Function steps when you need procedural work such as:
- Calling an API
- Writing metrics/state changes
- Calculations that decide routing

### Exit flow
Use Exit flows to:
- End the conversation cleanly
- Represent a handoff
- Make terminal paths obvious

## Quickstart: build your first flow

This walkthrough builds a simple booking flow:
- Collect phone number (or fallback to email)
- Collect booking details
- Route large parties to handoff
- Finish

### Step 1 — Create a flow
1. Go to **Flows**
2. Click **+ Create flow**
3. Name it (example: **Make a booking**)

Tip: start with a Default step as your first step for the smoothest no-code experience.

### Step 2 — Add your first Default step (entry point)
1. Add a **Default step**
2. Name it **Collect contact details**
3. In the **Prompt**, paste something like:

> Ask for the caller’s phone number to create or look up the booking.
> If they don’t want to provide a phone number, ask for an email address instead.
> Confirm back what you captured in one sentence.

### Step 3 — Add entities to the step
In **Collect contact details**, add:
- **Phone number**
- **Email address** (as the fallback)

This tells the system what information to extract and (where supported) validate.

### Step 4 — Add a finish/exit step
1. Add another **Exit flow**
2. Name it **Booking complete**

## Write condition labels for humans first
Good labels are short and unambiguous:
- `phone collected`
- `phone missing`
- `party size > 10`
- `caller refuses`
- `unclear`

Avoid labels that overlap or require interpretation:
- `valid`
- `ok`
- `continue`

## Entities

Entities are structured values the agent can collect and reuse, such as:
- Phone number
- Email
- Date/time
- Address
- Name

### Validation
Depending on the entity type and configuration, extracted values can be:
- **Valid** (usable)
- **Invalid** (treat as not collected; ask again or route to fallback)

Best practice:
- If a route depends on an entity being present, include a sibling fallback route for missing/invalid inputs.

## Glossary

- **Step (node):** A unit of conversation.
- **Edge:** A connection between steps.
- **Condition:** A label explaining when an edge should be taken.
- **Entity:** Typed extracted data (phone, date, address, etc.).
- **Exit flow:** A terminal node (finish/handoff).
- **Advanced step:** A step with transition functions and custom logic.
