**PolyAI Flow Builder** lets you create conversational workflows visually — no coding, no friction.

With a clean drag-and-drop interface, you can design, test, and manage voice agents that handle complex tasks, powered entirely by natural language prompts and entity recognition.

Each step in the flow corresponds to a node on the canvas. Simply connect them visually to define logic, conditions, and handoffs.
No Python, no transition functions — just clear, intuitive conversation design.

## Visual Flow Design

The **Flow Builder** presents your conversation as a visual map.

Each box on the canvas is a **step**. Steps connect through **edges**, which represent transitions between nodes.

- **Default step** — Configure natural-language prompts and entity extraction directly, no code required.
- **Advanced step** — For power users, allows adding transition functions and custom logic.
- **Exit flow** — Ends the conversation or hands off to another process.

You can switch between these step types while designing, giving you the flexibility to blend simple and advanced logic in one flow.

## How It Works

1. **Create a new flow**
   Open **Flows → + Create flow**, and choose your starting node (e.g., *Make a booking*).

2. **Add steps visually**
   Click the **+** icon on the canvas or right-click to insert a new node. Select *Default step*, *Advanced step*, or *Exit flow*.

3. **Write a prompt**
   Each Default step includes a *Prompt* field powered by LLM instructions. For example:
   > “Ask the caller whether we can use the phone number calling from as a booking number.”

4. **Extract entities**
   Add or reuse entity types (e.g., **Phone Number**, **Email Address**, **Date**, **Time**, **Party Size**) directly in the node.
   Entity extraction uses standardized validation and ASR biasing to ensure accuracy.

5. **Connect nodes**
   Drag arrows between nodes to define transitions.
   - Label edges with conditions such as `phone number collected` or `party size > 10`.
   - The LLM dynamically selects the route that fits the context.

6. **Preview and test**
   Click **Publish** or open the **Test suite** to simulate live calls and verify flow behavior.

## Example Flow: Booking Scenario

The screenshots above show a sample flow titled **Make a booking**, demonstrating:

- Phone number collection and fallback to email if not provided
- Date, time, and party-size gathering
- Conditional branching (e.g., party size above 10 triggers a handoff)
- Handoff to front desk or exit flow

This visual logic replaces complex transition functions with simple node connections and labels, making flow reasoning accessible at a glance.


## Feature Highlights

- **Visual, No-Code Builder** — Build intelligent call flows without engineering support.
- **AI-Powered Steps** — Configure each step using natural language prompts powered by PolyAI’s large language model.
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflow Design** — Instantly connect steps and reshape logic visually.
- **Smart Entity Recognition** — Built-in ASR biasing and validation for phone numbers, names, and other structured data.
- **Conditional Logic** — Create branching conversations that adapt to every caller’s intent and context.
- **Hybrid Design** — Combine Default and Advanced steps for maximum flexibility.

## Metrics of Success

- Reduction in average build time for new flows
- Fewer test chats required per completed flow
- Higher adoption among partners and client builders
- Improved clarity and maintainability of flow logic

## What’s Next

The no-code foundation supports future enhancements, including:

- **Entity management page** — View and track entities across flows
- **Agent memory integration** — Persist entity values beyond a single call
- **Multimodal flow building** — Add SMS, handoff, and follow-up actions
- **AI Builder Assistant** — A co-pilot that helps you create and debug flows automatically
