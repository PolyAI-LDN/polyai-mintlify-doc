title: 'Object'
description: 'The `Flow` object exposes useful information about the current flow and allows transitioning between steps in the flow.'
---

The `Flow` object gives you control over how the agent moves between steps in a flow. It is most commonly used inside **transition functions**, where deterministic logic determines what happens next.

<Warning>
Only the **last** `flow.goto_step()` call in a function is executed. To prevent accidental overrides, always use `return` immediately after a `goto_step()` call — unless you're explicitly chaining transitions.
</Warning>

## `current_step` (Property)

**Type:** `string`
**Returns:** The name of the current step the agent is in.

```python
if flow.current_step == "Collect Name":
    return "You're in the name collection step."
```

Use this for debugging or conditional routing.


## `goto_step(step_name)` (Method)

Use `flow.goto_step()` to move the agent to another step in the flow. This replaces the current step's prompt and functions with those of the target step.

```python
flow.goto_step("Confirm Name")
return
```

Only the prompt and functions in the **current step** are visible to the LLM — step names, flow names, and previous prompts are not included in its context.

<Note>
Use `return` immediately after calling `goto_step()` to avoid silent failures. Only the final call in a function is executed.
</Note>

### Conditional transition example

```python
if conv.state.has_phone_number:
    flow.goto_step("Confirm phone number")
    return
else:
    flow.goto_step("Collect phone number")
    return
```

### Input validation and state update

```python
def transition_to_confirm_name(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, first_name: str, last_name: str):
    if not first_name or not last_name:
        return "Please make sure we have both first and last name before continuing."

    conv.state.first_name = first_name
    conv.state.last_name = last_name

    flow.goto_step("Confirm Name")
    return
```

This is the recommended structure for transition logic: validate input, update state, transition, then return.

<Note>
If your function is called `go_to_step_two`, the LLM may generate irrelevant responses like "Okay, moving on." Use intent-based names like `check_user_info` or `verify_email` to anchor model behavior.
</Note>

## Best practices

- Design flows like **state machines** — each step represents a specific state with a clear transition path.
- Keep transition functions short and scoped to a single decision.
- Avoid chaining multiple function calls in the same function — consolidate them into a single utility or flow function.

## Good to know

- Any step in a flow can be designated as the **start step** in the UI.
- Use `current_step` for step-aware debugging or conditional re-routing.
- **Exit steps** are defined using `conv.exit_flow()` and are visually marked in yellow in the Flow Editor.
- Transition functions live **inside flows**, not globally — reuse shared logic with global utility functions instead.
- Function names affect both **behavior and language** — treat them as part of your prompt design.
