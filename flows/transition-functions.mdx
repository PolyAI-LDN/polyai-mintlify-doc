title: Managing transition functions

![flow-functions](/images/flow-functions-button.png)

Find the **<Icon icon="arrow-progress" iconType="solid" /> Flow functions**
button in the bottom-right corner of the flow editor. Click it to open a modal displaying a searchable list of all the [functions](/function/introduction) associated with the flow.

1. If no transitions exist, you can manually create them by connecting steps.
2. When selecting a step to connect, you can **name the transition** rather than relying on an auto-generated name.
3. If a name is already in use, an error message will prompt you to resolve it before proceeding.
4. Once a transition is created, the UI displays its **references**, showing how many times it appears in prompts.
5. Transitions can be managed in two ways:

      - **Directly from a step**, by selecting an option from the context menu.
      - **In the flow editor**, by selecting an existing transition and connecting steps accordingly.
6. Users can also **duplicate** transitions, in which case the duplicate will automatically be uniquely named.
