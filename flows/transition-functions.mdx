Transition functions are tied to a specific flow. They should not be confused with [global functions](/function/introduction), which can be used across [flows](introduction), in the [global rules](/agent-settings/rules), and in the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction).

To view and manage transition functions, click the **<Icon icon="arrow-progress" iconType="solid" /> Flow functions** button in the bottom-right corner of the Flow Editor. This opens a searchable modal showing all **transition** functions associated with the current flow.

## Creating and managing transitions

Use transition functions to control how your assistant moves from one step to another, using the open-code Python fields that you can find in other transition items around Agent Studio.

Here's how you can create a new transition function:

1. **Connect two steps**
   If no transition exists, linking two steps will prompt you to create one.

2. **Name your transition**
   You'll be asked to name the new transition function. Clear, intent-based names improve flow readability and LLM alignment.

3. **Handle name conflicts**
   If the name is already in use, the UI will show an error. Rename the function before proceeding.

4. **View usage references**
   After creation, the UI shows how many times the transition function is referenced in prompts.

## Managing transition functions

You can manage transition functions in two ways:

- **From a step**
  Open the step’s context menu and select an existing transition or create a new one.

- **From the Flow Functions modal**
  Use the modal to view, rename, delete, or connect transitions to steps.

### Duplicating

Duplicating a transition will auto-generate a unique name. You can then update the logic or connect it to different steps.

## Example: conditional transition logic

A transition function typically checks state and moves to the appropriate step:

```python
def check_user_verified(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow):
    if conv.state.user_verified:
        flow.goto_step("Account details")
    else:
        flow.goto_step("Verify identity")
    return
```

<Tip>
Always use `return` at the end of your transition function. Omitting it can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Best practices

- Keep transition functions focused, with one job and one output.
- Use action- or intent-based names like `check_user_verified`, `handle_no_availability`.
- Avoid vague or structural names like `goto_step_two` or `continue_flow` — they confuse the LLM and make flows harder to debug.
- Transition functions are only visible to the LLM if referenced in the current step.
- They are attached to the current flow, so they are not shared globally. They will not show up in the [functions](/function/introduction) tab.
- Use them to encapsulate branching logic and control step sequencing — not to generate assistant responses.

<Tab title="Avoid">
Never chain multiple function calls in a single step. This will always increase the failure rate, and it makes flow behavior unpredictable.
```python
save_user_input()
check_availability()
flow.goto_step("Next")
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Instead, use...">
Keep individual step logic consolidated into one function wherever possible.
```python
def save_and_check(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, value: str):
    conv.state.value = value
    if check_availability(value):
        flow.goto_step("Confirm booking")
    else:
        flow.goto_step("Unavailable")
    return
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
<Tip>
If your transition function needs to trigger user-facing output, return a message string at the end. Otherwise, let the assistant respond from the step prompt.
