To view and manage transition functions, click the **<Icon icon="arrow-progress" iconType="solid" /> Flow functions** button in the bottom-right corner of the Flow Editor. This opens a searchable modal showing all [functions](/function/introduction) associated with the current flow.

## Creating and managing transitions

Transition functions control how your assistant moves from one step to another. You can create and edit them directly in the Flow Editor.

1. **Create manually by connecting steps**
   If no transition exists, linking two steps will prompt you to create one.

2. **Name your transition**
   You'll be asked to name the new transition function. Clear, intent-based names improve flow readability and LLM alignment.

3. **Handle name conflicts**
   If the name is already in use, the UI will show an error. Rename the function before proceeding.

4. **View usage references**
   After creation, the UI shows how many times the transition function is referenced in prompts.

## Where to manage transitions

You can manage transition functions in two ways:

- **From a step**
  Open the step’s context menu and select an existing transition or create a new one.

- **From the Flow Functions modal**
  Use the modal to view, rename, delete, or connect transitions to steps.

## Duplicating transitions

Duplicating a transition will auto-generate a unique name. You can then update the logic or connect it to different steps.

## Example: conditional transition logic

A transition function typically checks state and moves to the appropriate step:

```python
def check_user_verified(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow):
    if conv.state.user_verified:
        flow.goto_step("Account details")
    else:
        flow.goto_step("Verify identity")
    return
```

<Tip>
Always use `return` at the end of your transition function. Omitting it can lead to unexpected behavior.
</Tip>


## Best practices

- ✅ Keep transition functions focused — one job, one output.
- ✅ Use action- or intent-based names like `check_user_verified`, `handle_no_availability`.
- ❌ Avoid vague or structural names like `goto_step_two` or `continue_flow` — they confuse the LLM and make flows harder to debug.
- ❌ **Never chain multiple function calls in a single step.** This increases failure rates and makes flow behavior unpredictable. Consolidate logic into one function wherever possible.

```python
# ❌ Avoid this pattern
save_user_input()
check_availability()
flow.goto_step("Next")
```

```python
# ✅ Do this instead
def save_and_check(conv: Conversation, flow: Flow, value: str):
    conv.state.value = value
    if check_availability(value):
        flow.goto_step("Confirm booking")
    else:
        flow.goto_step("Unavailable")
    return
```

## Important notes

- Transition functions are **only visible to the LLM if referenced in the current step**.
- They are **scoped to the current flow** — not shared globally.
- Use them to encapsulate branching logic and control step sequencing — not to generate assistant responses.

<Note>
If your transition function needs to trigger user-facing output, return a message string at the end. Otherwise, let the assistant respond from the step prompt.
