Flows can be triggered in several ways depending on where you are in the platform and how deterministic the interaction needs to be.

This page provides a simple overview of every supported method.


## 1. Trigger a flow programmatically (conv.goto_flow)

This is the most explicit and reliable method.

Use this inside a function when you want to start a flow deterministically.

Example:

```python
    conv.goto_flow("Make a booking")
```

What happens:

- The current turn finishes.
- The named flow starts on the next turn.
- The user enters the flow at its entry step.

Use this when:

- You need strict control.
- An API response determines the next action.
- You are escalating to a structured interaction.
- You are switching from unstructured chat to guided logic.

## 2. Trigger a flow from a Knowledge Base action

You can configure a Knowledge Base topic to start a flow.

Typical pattern:

- The user asks something.
- The KB topic matches.
- The KB action starts the flow.
- The flow takes over to collect input, validate, retry, or finish.

Use this when:

- A specific intent should always enter a structured flow.
- You want to keep high-level intent matching in the KB layer.
- The interaction requires multiple steps.

This is LLM-triggered but guided by configuration.

## 3. Trigger a flow from inside another flow

You can move from one flow to another.

Common cases:

- Escalation
- Payments
- Identity verification
- Restarting a structured interaction
- Switching task contexts

Implementation:

Use `conv.goto_flow` inside a function step or transition function.

Example:

```python
    conv.goto_flow("Escalation flow")
```

The new flow begins on the next turn.

## 4. Trigger a flow after an API result

Flows do not automatically trigger from APIs.

Instead:

- A Function step calls an API.
- Your code evaluates the response.
- You either:
  - Route within the current flow using flow.goto_step
  - Or start a new flow using conv.goto_flow

Example:

```python
    response = conv.api.crm.lookup_user(id="123")
    data = response.json()

    if data["status"] == "requires_verification":
        conv.goto_flow("Verification flow")
```

This gives you full control over system-driven routing.

## 5. Triggering via Agent configuration (intent-driven entry)

In some setups, flows are mapped to top-level intents or entry conditions at the agent configuration layer.

This allows:

- A specific user request to directly start a flow.
- Structured handling without intermediate steps.

Use this when:

- A business workflow should always begin immediately.
- You want deterministic entry for regulated or compliance-sensitive flows.

## Choosing the right method

- `conv.goto_flow` when you need explicit control.
- Knowledge Base actions when the trigger is intent-based.
- Internal flow switching when moving between structured tasks.
- Use API-driven logic when external systems determine next steps.
