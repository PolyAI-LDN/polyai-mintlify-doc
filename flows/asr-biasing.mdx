Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) biasing helps the assistant better understand expected types of user input in each step. It’s especially useful for improving recognition of:

- Alphanumeric codes
- Names and name spellings
- Dates, times, and party sizes
- Addresses and yes/no responses

You can configure ASR biasing on any **flow step** to boost transcription accuracy.

## Where it appears

In the **step editor**, you'll see an **ASR biasing** panel on the right-hand side when editing a step prompt.

Options include:

- **Alphanumeric** – for booking references or confirmation codes
- **Name spelling** – for phonetically spelled names (e.g., “A for apple”)
- **Numeric** – for ages or short numbers
- **Party size** – for group bookings
- **Precise/Relative date** – for specific or flexible time requests
- **Single number** – for one-digit responses like menu selection
- **Time** – for spoken times (e.g., “half past eight”)
- **Yes/No** – for confirmation-style responses
- **Address** – for location names, postcodes, or street numbers

Custom keyword fields can also be added to bias transcription toward domain-specific vocabulary.

## When to use it

Enable ASR biasing when:

- Users are likely to say structured input like a booking code or date
- You're seeing frequent transcription errors or misrecognitions
- The assistant is making incorrect guesses from unclear audio

Avoid overusing biasing when:

- Input is unstructured or conversational
- You're collecting open-ended or ambiguous responses
- Your flow already handles fallback well

## Example in a flow

In this example, the assistant is collecting a confirmation code. Because users often say mixed letters and numbers, we toggle **Alphanumeric** biasing.

This increases the likelihood that phrases like *“X9C7G2”* are heard and transcribed accurately.

## Best practices

- Match ASR bias to the **input type**, not the prompt phrasing
- Combine biasing with **few-shot prompting** if needed (e.g. for spelled names)
- Always test key steps with real voice input

<Note>
ASR biasing doesn’t force the model to interpret things a certain way — it just nudges transcription toward expected patterns.
