Flows are a powerful tool for guiding deterministic agent behavior. You can use them to gain greater control by breaking down conversations into discrete steps to guide your
agent in complex tasks like booking, altering, and canceling reservations.

A **flow** is a series of steps that guide the agent through a structured interaction. Each step in a flow has its own unique prompt, similar
to the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) content field. This modular design makes flows particularly useful for scenarios like
collecting user information, processing requests for reservations or bookings, or structuring dynamic conversations with complex logic.

Flows are triggered by specific [functions](/function/introduction) or [action fields](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction), and once a flow is active, the agent will progress through its steps sequentially,
following defined transition rules.

## Key features

### 1. Step-by-step prompts
Each step in a flow has a dedicated prompt to keep processing focused. This helps ensure
the agent processes one task at a time, and does not include any superfluous information in its answers.

### 2. Hidden prompts
Only the current step's prompt is visible to the model, keeping the conversation on track. This prevents the agent from "seeing"
future steps.

### 3. Transition functions
Transition functions move the agent from one step to the next. These functions are defined within the flow and can only route to other
 steps within the same flow.

### 4. Global functions
Functions not tied to specific steps can be used throughout the agent's workflows. These functions allow for reusable logic, such as API
calls or user input validation.

### 5. ASR biasing
Flows support **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) biasing** to improve transcription accuracy. This is especially useful for collecting
 alphanumeric data like postcodes or phone numbers.

## Best practices for flows

### Keep steps concise
- Ensure each step handles a single cohesive task, like collecting a name or date.
- When handling related pieces of information like the date, time, and number of people for a restaurant booking, combine them into one step for cohesion.

### Use meaningful function names
- Use descriptive names for functions (for example, `SaveLastName` or `CollectPhoneNumber`).
- Avoid naming functions based on future tasks (e.g., `GoToNextStep`), as this can confuse the model.

### Keep your design modular
- Use flows to encapsulate logic for specific tasks, like booking a reservation or handling a customer query.
- Incorporate fallback mechanisms to handle unexpected inputs.

### Always exit flows
- Always include an explicit exit function (`ExitFlow`) to prevent the agent from looping through unnecessary steps.
- Exiting the flow resets the agent's focus, allowing it to handle new user queries effectively.

<Warning> Always include an exit step in your flow. Un-exited flows can cause <Tooltip tip="Incorrect or misleading results.">hallucinations</Tooltip>. </Warning>

## Advanced features

### Conditional logic
Flows can include conditions to dynamically adapt responses based on user input. For example:
- If a user provides a specific date, the agent can check availability and guide the user accordingly.

### Variables in prompts
Flows support the use of [variables](/variant-management/introduction) to dynamically fill in information during interactions. This allows for personalized and context-aware responses.

### ASR biasing
- Configure ASR biasing for specific steps to improve transcription accuracy for numbers, postcodes, or other alphanumeric inputs.
- Boost keywords to prioritize relevant user inputs during transcription.

## Example flow

<Tip> Full or partial flows can be easily copied between projects using `Cmd/Ctrl + C` and `Cmd/Ctrl + V` </Tip>

Here's an example of a flow for making a restaurant reservation:

1. **Start step**: Collect the date, time, and number of people.
   - Prompt: "What date and time would you like to book a table for? How many people will be dining?"
   - Function: `CollectReservationDetails`

2. **Check availability**:
   - Call an API to check availability based on user input.
   - If available: Transition to the confirmation step.
   - If unavailable: Prompt the user to choose a different time.

3. **Confirmation step**:
   - Prompt: "Great! Your table is booked for [date] at [time] for [number of people]. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
   - Function: `ExitFlow`

## Connecting steps

![connect-flow-steps](/images/connect-flow-steps.png)

You can connect flow steps from the **prompt** field:

 1. Type "/" in the prompt field.
 2. Scroll down until you find **Steps**.
 3. You will see a searchable and scrollable list of all the current flow steps. Select one to create a flow function.
 4. Name your transition flow function, or retain the autogenerated name.in

### Managing transition functions

![flow-functions](/images/flow-functions-button.png)

Find the **<Icon icon="arrow-progress" iconType="solid" /> Flow functions**
button in the bottom-right corner of the flow editor. Click it to open a modal displaying a searchable list of all the [functions](/function/introduction) associated with the flow.

1. If no transitions exist, you can manually create them by connecting steps.
2. When selecting a step to connect, you can **name the transition** rather than relying on an auto-generated name.
3. If a name is already in use, an error message will prompt you to resolve it before proceeding.
4. Once a transition is created, the UI displays its **references**, showing how many times it appears in prompts.
5. Transitions can be managed in two ways:

      - **Directly from a step**, by selecting an option from the context menu.
      - **In the flow editor**, by selecting an existing transition and connecting steps accordingly.
6. Users can also **duplicate** transitions, in which case the duplicate will automatically be uniquely named.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing exit step**: Failing to exit a flow can lead to the agent repeating unnecessary steps or ignoring new user queries.
- **Overloading steps**: Including too much information in a single step can overwhelm both the agent and the user.
- **Poorly-named functions**: Functions with vague or misleading names can cause unexpected behavior. Remember that when using
the PolyAI Agent Studio, all title and description fields matter to the LLM.
