A flow, or [Talk Track](/glossary/introduction#talk-tracks), is a structured interaction made up of **steps**, each containing a [prompt](/knowledge-base/introduction) and one or more [actions](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction). You use flows when an interaction requires:

- Collecting user input (e.g. name, phone number, confirmation code)
- Performing validation or retries
- Calling internal or external APIs
- Routing, handoff, or escalation
- Following a specific sequence to meet business logic or regulatory requirements

<Note>
Use individual [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) entries for short, factual answers. Use a flow when interaction needs structure, memory, or logic.
</Note>

## How flows work

Each flow is made up of:

- **Steps**: Self-contained conversation states. Each has a prompt and a set of allowed functions.
- [Global functions](/function/introduction) and [transition functions](transition-functions): Logic blocks that validate input, call APIs, store values, and move the conversation forward.

What the LLM sees:
- The current step's text prompt.
- A list of available functions with names, descriptions, and arguments.

What the LLM doesn’t see:
- Previous step prompts.
- Any system context, unless it’s surfaced in the prompt or state.

<Tip>
Because previous steps are not visible, each prompt must be **self-contained**. Provide all necessary context and clear guidance in each step.
</Tip>

## LLM interaction model

When the assistant is inside a flow step, this is the input order:

1. System prompt (includes [Rules](/agent-settings/rules) and [About](/agent-settings/about) agent configuration).
2. Any relevant knowledge base entries (if applicable).
3. The conversation history.
4. The **step prompt** (which is appended last).

This makes the step prompt the **most influential** part of the LLM's input.

## Key techniques

- [Transition functions](transition-functions) control the flow's routing logic.
- Use [few-shot prompting](few-shot-prompting) to clarify expected inputs or edge cases.
- Set [ASR biasing](asr-biasing) to improve voice transcription for structured or ambiguous values like confirmation codes or personal names.

## Connecting steps

In the Flow Editor:

- Use `/Steps` in the prompt to connect to the next step
- Add named transition functions to manage movement between states
- Use the **Flow Functions** modal to see all transitions in one place

<Note>
Use descriptive function names like `check_reservation_match`, not vague ones like `step_two` — this helps the LLM reason correctly.
