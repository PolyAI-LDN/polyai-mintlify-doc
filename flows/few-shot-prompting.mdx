[Few-shot prompting (FSP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-prompting) is a technique for guiding the LLM by showing it examples of what users might say — and how the agent should respond. Inside a flow step, this helps the agent:

- Match vague or unexpected inputs to the correct function call
- Extract values in tricky formats (e.g., spelled names, long reference codes)
- Avoid asking unnecessary questions when the value is already present
- Maintain a consistent tone, phrasing, or logic pattern

## Why it matters in flow steps

In a flow, the agent only sees:
- The **current step prompt**
- The **listed functions** (names, descriptions, arguments)

It **does not** see previous step prompts or conversation state unless you surface them.

That means each step must stand alone — and few-shot prompting fills in the gaps by giving the model examples to reason from.

<Tip>
Because step prompts are inserted last in the LLM input stack, FSP examples appear directly before the model generates its next turn — making them highly influential.

## Basic structure

Each few-shot example consists of:

- A realistic **user message**
- A matching **agent behavior** — often a response + function call

Place these inside the **step prompt**, either inline or at the top before your main instructions.

You don't need dozens of examples — usually **2–3** is enough, especially if you cover:
- A standard, clean input
- A tricky edge case
- A fallback or clarification

## Tips for strong few-shot examples

- Use realistic language — not idealized or overly formal examples.
- Show both success and edge cases.
