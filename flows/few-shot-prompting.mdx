Few-shot prompting (FSP) is a technique for guiding the LLM by showing it examples of what users might say — and how the assistant should respond. Inside a flow step, this helps the assistant:

- Match vague or unexpected inputs to the correct function call
- Extract values in tricky formats (e.g., spelled names, long reference codes)
- Avoid asking unnecessary questions when the value is already present
- Maintain a consistent tone, phrasing, or logic pattern

## Why it matters in flow steps

In a flow, the assistant only sees:
- The **current step prompt**
- The **listed functions** (names, descriptions, arguments)

It **does not** see previous step prompts or conversation state unless you surface them.

That means each step must stand alone — and few-shot prompting fills in the gaps by giving the model examples to reason from.

<Tip>
Because step prompts are inserted last in the LLM input stack, FSP examples appear directly before the model generates its next turn — making them highly influential.

## Basic structure

Each few-shot example consists of:

- A realistic **user message**
- A matching **assistant behavior** — often a response + function call

Place these inside the **step prompt**, either inline or at the top before your main instructions.

```plaintext
User: My name’s John.
Assistant: Got it — calling `save_name("John")`.

User: It’s A for apple, L for lemon, I for ink, C for cat, E for echo.
Assistant: Thanks — that’s "Alice". Calling `save_name("Alice")` now.
```

You don’t need dozens of examples — usually **2–3** is enough, especially if you cover:
- A standard, clean input
- A tricky edge case
- A fallback or clarification

## Example: phone number collection step

Here’s what a real flow step might look like with few-shot prompting included:

```plaintext
User: It’s 07912 345 678.
Assistant: Great, I’ve got 07912345678. Calling `save_phone_number()` now.

User: Oh sorry, it’s 07888 888 888.
Assistant: No problem — updating to 07888888888. Calling `save_phone_number()` now.

Please provide your phone number so we can reach you if needed.

## Tips for strong few-shot examples

- Use **realistic language** — not idealized or overly formal examples
- Show both **success cases** and **edge cases**
- Include the function call syntax to reinforce the expected outcome
- Put examples **before** the final instruction in your step prompt

<Note>
Few-shot examples are instructions — not decoration. The LLM learns from them in real time.
