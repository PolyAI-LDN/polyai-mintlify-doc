The Users Management feature offers two roles with different levels of access and permissions:

## Admin Role

The Admin role provides users with full access to the workspace, allowing them to manage all aspects of the projects and configurations. Admin users have the highest level of permissions and can perform tasks such as creating and editing projects, managing users, and accessing all features within the workspace.

## Member Role

The Member role is designed for users who require project-level permissions. Members can have varying levels of access to individual projects, depending on their assigned permissions. The available project-level permissions include:

- **No Access**: Users with no access to a project cannot view or interact with it.
- **Reader**: Readers can view project content but cannot make changes.
- **Editor**: Editors have full access to a project and can make changes to its content.

In addition to project-level permissions, Members may also have resource-level permissions within each project. The following resource hierarchy is supported:

1. **Build**: Contains sections related to creating and configuring assistant functionality, such as knowledge base, voice settings, about, rules, functions, call handoffs, and SMS settings.
2. **Analyze**: Includes features for analyzing and monitoring assistant performance, such as overview (dashboard) and conversations.
3. **Configure**: Encompasses settings for configuring workspace and project-level settings.

By assigning appropriate roles and permissions, you can control access to your workspace and ensure that users have the necessary level of access to perform their tasks effectively.
