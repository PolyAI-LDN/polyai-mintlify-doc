Invite colleagues to join your workspace and collaborate on projects with ease using the Users Management feature. Follow these steps to invite users:

## Step 1: Accessing Users Page

Navigate to the account landing page and locate the "Users" tab at the top alongside other tabs like Assistant, Billing, and Secrets. Click on the "Users" tab to proceed. Note that only "Admin" users have access to the user management feature.

## Step 2: Viewing User List

Upon accessing the Users page, you'll see a list of users who have access to your workspace. This list includes their email addresses, roles, groups they belong to, and projects they have access to.

## Step 3: Adding New Users

Click the top right "Add" button to initiate the process of adding a new user. A new window will pop up where you can enter the email address(es) of the user(s) you wish to invite. You can enter multiple emails at once by copy and paste or typing them in and pressing enter.

## Step 4: Assigning Roles

Choose the appropriate role for the new user(s) from the available options: Admin or Member. Refer to the "Role Permission" page for details on each role's permissions.

## Step 5: Group Assignment (Optional)

The "Group" field is optional and allows you to tag users into different groups for easy user management. You can assign users to specific groups to streamline collaboration and organization within your workspace.

## Step 6: Confirmation

After providing the necessary details, click "Confirm" to save the changes. The new users will now appear in your user table.

By following these steps, you can easily invite colleagues to join your workspace and collaborate on projects effectively.
