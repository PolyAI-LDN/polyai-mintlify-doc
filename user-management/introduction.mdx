# User Management

Welcome to the Users Management feature, a powerful tool designed to facilitate collaboration and streamline account management within your organization. Whether you're inviting colleagues to join your account or assigning roles to control access and permissions, the Users Management feature offers the flexibility and control you need to manage your team effectively.

## Collaboration Benefits

Collaboration is key to success in building the best voice assistant, and the Users Management feature empowers you to foster collaboration among your team members. By inviting colleagues to join your account, you can unlock the potential to drive innovation and develop the best voice assistant for your business.

## Role-based Access Control

In addition to inviting users, the Users Management feature allows you to assign roles to control access and permissions. Whether you need to grant full editing capabilities or provide read-only access for transparency and visibility, role-based access control ensures that each user has the appropriate level of access to your account.

## Data Security and Transparency

At PolyAI, we prioritize data security and transparency. The Users Management feature not only improves collaboration but also ensures that sensitive information is protected and accessible only to authorized users. By assigning roles with specific permissions, you can maintain control over your account while promoting transparency and accountability within your organization.
