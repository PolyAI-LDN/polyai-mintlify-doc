description: Define and call external APIs directly from Agent Studio without writing custom request code.
---

The APIs tab lets you define external HTTP APIs directly in Agent Studio and reference and include them when you are building [functions](/function/introduction) and [flows](/flows/introduction).

![api-tab](/images/api-tab-create.png)

It provides:
- A shared, inspectable API definition
- [Environment-specific](/environments-and-versions/introduction) base URLs
- A consistent calling interface inside `conv.api`

This page explains what the APIs tab does and how to call defined APIs from your agent.

## What the APIs tab is for

Use the APIs tab when you want your agent to:
- Fetch or send data to an external system
- Call internal services (CRM, ticketing, booking, payments)
- Avoid maintaining potentially weighty custom HTTP logic in functions

Typical use cases:
- Look up a ticket, booking, or account
- Create or update a record
- Trigger downstream systems from a flow

## How API definitions work

An API definition consists of:
1. A named API
2. Environment-specific base URLs
3. One or more operations

## API name

The API name becomes the namespace under conv.api.

Example:
- API name: `salesforce`
- Runtime access: `conv.api.salesforce`

## Base URL and environments

Each API supports separate configuration for:
- Draft / Sandbox
- Pre-release
- Live

This allows you to:
- Test against staging services
- Promote safely without changing code
- Keep flows identical across environments

At runtime, the agent automatically uses the base URL for the active environment.

## Operations

Each operation represents a single HTTP endpoint.

You define:
- Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Operation name
- Resource path

Example resource path:
  `/tickets/{ticket_id}`

Path variables are automatically exposed as arguments when calling the operation.

## Referencing APIs while you are building an agent

![api-tab-runtime](/images/api-tab-reference.png)

All defined APIs are available inside functions under the conv.api object.

The structure is:

```python
  conv.api.<api_name>.<operation_name>(...)
  ```

## Path variables

You can pass path variables as positional or keyword arguments.

Examples:

```python
  response = conv.api.salesforce.get_contact("123")
```

Or:

```python
  response = conv.api.salesforce.get_contact(contact_id="123")
```

## Query parameters, body, and headers

Operations accept arbitrary keyword arguments at call time.

You can pass:
- Query parameters
- JSON bodies
- Custom headers

Example:

```python
  response = conv.api.stripe.create_payment(
    amount=100,
    params={"expand": "customer"},
    json={"amount": 100, "currency": "usd"},
    headers={"X-Custom-Header": "value"}
  )
```

This behaves similarly to a thin wrapper around a standard HTTP client.

## Authentication

Authentication is configured at the API level.

Supported auth types include:
- No auth
- Header-based auth (for example, API keys)
- Other configured mechanisms depending on deployment

Auth credentials are handled by Agent Studio and are not embedded in flows or functions.

## Summary

The APIs tab provides:
- Centralized API configuration
- Environment-aware routing
- A simple runtime interface with `conv.api`
