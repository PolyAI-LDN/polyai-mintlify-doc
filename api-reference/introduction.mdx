Welcome to the PolyAI API documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating the PolyAI API into your projects.

## Regional API endpoints

PolyAI provides API endpoints in three regions to ensure optimal performance and compliance with regional regulations. Choose the appropriate base URL for your region:

| Region | Base URL                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US     | [https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app](https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app)   |
| UK     | [https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app](https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app)   |
| EUW    | [https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app](https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app) |

## Authentication

PolyAI supports API key authentication to ensure secure access to our API endpoints. Each account, and optionally each project, will be provisioned with a unique API key. Follow the steps below to authenticate your requests using the API key.

### API Key authentication

To authenticate your API requests, include the API key in the request headers. Use the `x-api-key` header to pass your API key.

#### Request Header example

```http
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Securing your API key

Your API key is a sensitive credential and should be kept secure. Do not share it publicly or include it in client-side code. Always store your API key in a secure location, such as environment variables or a secrets management service.
Contact the PolyAI team immediately if your API key is compromised.
