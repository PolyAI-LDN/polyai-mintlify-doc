Welcome to the PolyAI API documentation. This page gives you the minimum you need to understand before you start wiring anything up: regions, API surface, versions, and authentication.

## Regional API endpoints

PolyAI provides regional API endpoints to keep latency low and meet data residency requirements. Use the base URL that matches your deployment region:

| Region | Base URL |
| ------ | -------- |
| US     | `https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app` |
| UK     | `https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app` |
| EUW    | `https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app` |

Most endpoints share this pattern:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/…`

Check each API’s page for the exact path and parameters.

## API surface

The main externally-documented APIs are:

- [Chat API](chat/introduction) – drive web/chat channels programmatically (WhatsApp, in-app widgets, email, etc.).
- **Conversations API** – fetch full conversation records for analytics and data pipelines.
- **Handoff API** – query handoff state for a conversation (for live-agent integrations).
- **Concurrent Calls API** – retrieve concurrency statistics over time windows.
- **DNI API** – reserve numbers for Dynamic Number Insertion journeys.
- **External Events API** – let external providers POST results back into active conversations.

All of these share the same regional base URLs; each has its own path and authentication requirements documented on its page.

## Conversations API versions

Only the **Conversations API** is versioned. Other APIs are currently unversioned.

### v3 – current and recommended

v3 is the latest and fully supported version of the Conversations API.

It runs on PolyAI’s event-sourced data platform and provides:

- reliable ingestion and querying at scale
- empty strings ("") instead of null for empty text fields
- extra turn-level fields such as latency, translated_user_input, and english_agent_response
- consistent ISO8601 timestamps across conversations, turns, and metrics
- project- and region-scoped API keys managed via the **Data access** page in Agent Studio

**Endpoint pattern**

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

<Tip>Authentication for v3 is managed internally by PolyAI.
Ask your PolyAI representative to provision a v3 key and confirm the project and region it is scoped to.</Tip>

### v2

v2 introduced the same schema and event-sourced backend as v3, but retained the older authentication model.

- same schema as v3
- same event-sourced backend as v3
- legacy auth (aligned with v1)

You will generally only encounter v2 in older internal or bespoke integrations.

### v1 – legacy

v1 uses an earlier, less scalable data pipeline and the legacy authentication model.

**Endpoint pattern**

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

**Lifecycle**

- From 3 March 2026, v1 moves to best-effort support (no SLA guarantees).
- After 31 August 2026, v1 is no longer supported. It may continue to run but should be treated as deprecated.

### Which version should I use?

- All new integrations must target v3.
- If you are currently on v1, plan to migrate to v3 before support ends.
- v2 should only be considered if you are maintaining an existing internal integration that already uses it.

## Authentication

PolyAI uses API keys for all externally exposed endpoints.

Include your key using the x-api-key header:

```python
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### API key provisioning

- **Legacy keys (v1 / older integrations)**
  May already exist for long-running deployments. These follow the legacy authentication model.

- **Conversations API v3 keys**
  Are project- and region-scoped and managed via the **Data access** page in Agent Studio.
  Keys are provisioned by PolyAI; contact your PolyAI representative to:
  • request a new key
  • confirm which project(s) and region(s) it applies to
  • discuss any custom metrics or access patterns

Some specialised endpoints (for example, the External Events API) use keys with a dedicated scope, documented on their respective pages.

### Security notes

- Treat API keys as secrets.
- Never commit keys to source control or expose them in client-side code.
