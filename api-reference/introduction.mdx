## Authentication

PolyAI supports API key authentication to ensure secure access to our API endpoints. Each account, and optionally each project, will be provisioned with a unique API key. Follow the steps below to authenticate your requests using the API key.

### API Key Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, include the API key in the request headers. Use the `x-api-key` header to pass your API key.

#### Request Header Example

```http
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Securing Your API Key
Your API key is a sensitive credential and should be kept secure. Do not share it publicly or include it in client-side code. Always store your API key in a secure location, such as environment variables or a secrets management service. Reach out to PolyAI team at once if there is a potential API leak happened.
