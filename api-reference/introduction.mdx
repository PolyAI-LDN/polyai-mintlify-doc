Welcome to the PolyAI API documentation. This guide introduces the core concepts you need before integrating with the PolyAI API, including regions, API versions, and authentication.

## Regional API endpoints

PolyAI provides regional API endpoints to ensure low latency and compliance with local data regulations. Use the base URL that matches your deployment region:

| Region | Base URL |
| ------ | -------- |
| US     | https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app |
| UK     | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app |
| EUW    | https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app |

Every API request begins with:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/…`

## Conversations API versions

### v3 – current and recommended

v3 is the latest and fully supported version of the Conversations API.

It runs on PolyAI’s event-sourced data platform, providing:

- reliable, real-time ingestion during high volumes
- empty strings ("") rather than `null` for empty text fields
- additional metadata such as `latency`, `translated_user_input`, and `english_agent_response`
- consistent timestamp formatting across all objects

<Tip>Authentication for v3 is managed internally by PolyAI.
Customers should request API access through their PolyAI representative.</Tip>

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

### v2

v2 introduced the same data pipeline and schema improvements found in v3 but continued to use the legacy authentication model.

It has:

- the same schema as v3
- the same event-sourced backend as v3
- an older authentication model (same as v1)

### v1 – legacy (scheduled for deprecation on 2 March 2026)

v1 uses an earlier, cron-driven data pipeline. While functional, it may experience delayed ingestion or missing records during peak traffic.

Differences from v3 include:

- null values instead of empty strings
- fewer fields and no translation or latency metadata
- inconsistent timestamp formats
- metrics configured through legacy project files
- older authentication workflow

Example:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

### Choosing a version

- All new integrations should use v3.
- Existing v1 users are encouraged to migrate before deprecation.
- v2 should be ignored unless you are maintaining historical internal integrations.

## Authentication

PolyAI uses API key authentication for all externally exposed endpoints.
Include your key using the x-api-key header:

```python
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### API key provisioning

- v1 keys may already exist for older deployments.
- v3 keys are issued directly by PolyAI.
  Customers must request access through their PolyAI contact.

### Security notes

API keys must be stored securely and must never appear in client-side code.
If you suspect that your key has been exposed, contact PolyAI immediately so it can be rotated.
