Welcome to the PolyAI API documentation. This page gives you the minimum you need before wiring anything up: regions, API surface, versions, and authentication.

## Regional API endpoints

PolyAI provides regional API endpoints to keep latency low and meet data residency requirements. Use the base URL that matches your deployment region:

| Region | Base URL |
| ------ | -------- |
| US     | `https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app` |
| UK     | `https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app` |
| EUW    | `https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app` |

Most endpoints follow this pattern:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/…`

Check each API’s page for exact paths and parameters.

## API surface

The externally documented APIs are:

- Chat API – drive chat channels programmatically (WhatsApp, in-app widgets, email, and more).
- Conversations API – fetch full conversation records for analytics and data pipelines.
- Handoff API – query handoff state for live-agent integrations.
- Concurrent Calls API – retrieve concurrency statistics over time windows.
- DNI API – reserve numbers for Dynamic Number Insertion journeys.
- External Events API – allow external providers to POST results into active conversations.

All APIs share the same regional base URLs; each has its own path and authentication model described on its page.

## Conversations API versions

Only the Conversations API is versioned. All other APIs are currently unversioned.

### v3 – current and recommended

v3 is the fully supported release of the Conversations API.
It runs on PolyAI’s event-sourced data platform and improves on v1 by offering:

- reliable ingestion and querying at scale
- empty strings ("") instead of `null` for empty text fields
- additional turn-level fields such as `latency`, `translated_user_input` and `english_agent_response`
- consistent ISO8601 timestamps across conversations, turns, and metrics

Endpoint pattern:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

<Tip>Most customers should use v3, the latest most performant version.</Tip>

Authentication for v3 is managed internally by PolyAI.
Ask your PolyAI representative to provision a v3 key and confirm the project and region it is scoped to.

### v2

v2 has the same schema as v3 but differs in authentication methods. Customers on v2 can continue using v2. New customers should use v3.

### v1 – legacy

v1 uses an earlier, less scalable data pipeline and the legacy auth model.

Endpoint pattern:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

**Deprecation plan**

Notice: v1 Conversations API is scheduled for deprecation.
On **2 March 2026**, v1 will move to best-effort support (no SLA guarantees).
On **31 August 2026**, v1 will remain available but no support will be provided.

### Which version should I use?

- All new integrations should use v3.
- Customers on v1 should plan their migration before support ends.
- v2 is only relevant for maintaining existing legacy internal integrations.

## Authentication

PolyAI uses API keys for all externally exposed endpoints.

Include your key using the x-api-key header:

```python
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### API key provisioning

- Legacy (v1/v2) keys
  May already exist and follow a legacy authentication model.

- Conversations API v3 keys
  Keys are provisioned by PolyAI.

### Security notes

- Treat API keys as secrets.
- Never embed keys in client-side code or commit them to source control.
- If a key is exposed, contact PolyAI immediately so it can be rotated.
