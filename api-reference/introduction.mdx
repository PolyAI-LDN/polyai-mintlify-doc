Welcome to the PolyAI API documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating the PolyAI API into your projects.

## Regional API endpoints

PolyAI provides API endpoints in three regions to ensure optimal performance and compliance with regional regulations. Choose the appropriate base URL for your region:

| Region | Base URL                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US     | https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app                                           |
| UK     | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app                                           |
| EUW    | https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app                                          |

## API versions

Some PolyAI APIs are versioned. For the Conversations API:

- `v3` is the current, recommended version for all new integrations.
- `v1` is considered legacy and is scheduled for deprecation on **2 March 2026**.

The base URL stays the same for your region. To use v3, change only the version segment in the path:

Legacy (v1 – to be deprecated):
`GET https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

Current (v3 – recommended):
`GET https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations`

For the Conversations API v3, the response schema is the same as v1, but:

- It is backed by a more reliable data pipeline.
- The metrics included in the response are configured in Agent Studio (Data access → Configuration) on a per-project basis.

## Authentication

PolyAI supports API key authentication to ensure secure access to our API endpoints. Each account, and optionally each project, will be provisioned with a unique API key. Follow the steps below to authenticate your requests using the API key.

### API Key authentication

To authenticate your API requests, include the API key in the request headers. Use the x-api-key header to pass your API key.

Request header example:

```script
GET /polyai-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: api.{region}.platform.polyai.app
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Securing your API key

Your API key is a sensitive credential and should be kept secure. Do not share it publicly or include it in client-side code. Store your API key in a secure location, such as environment variables or a secrets management service.
Contact the PolyAI team immediately if your API key is compromised.

For the Conversations API v3, you will typically use an API key generated from the Data access page in Agent Studio, scoped to the relevant project and region.
