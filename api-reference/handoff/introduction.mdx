---

The Handoff API allows downstream platforms—such as CCaaS systems, routing layers, or CRM integrations—to retrieve structured context when a conversation is handed off from a PolyAI agent.

This endpoint is typically used to support:
- routing decisions
- screen-pops for live agents
- attaching metadata to tickets or workflow systems
- passing through identifiers collected earlier in the call

## What the API returns

A successful response provides:

- `id` – the PolyAI conversation ID
- `shared_id` – an integrator-defined identifier, if one was stored
- `data` – a free-form JSON object containing the handoff metadata written by the agent

The data field may contain:
- customer identifiers  
- reasons for handoff  
- queue or routing hints  
- arbitrary key–value pairs describing caller state

## Regional base URLs

Region | Base URL
US     | https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app
UK     | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app
EUW    | https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app

Full endpoint structure:

`https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/{account_id}/{project_id}/handoff_state`

You must supply either:
- `id` (PolyAI conversation ID), or
- `shared_id` (a custom ID you passed into the system)

If both are supplied, shared_id takes precedence.

## Authentication

The Handoff API uses API key authentication via the x-api-key header.  
API keys are scoped to account, project, and region. Your PolyAI representative will confirm which key is configured for handoff retrieval.

## Typical flow

A downstream platform receives an inbound call that has just transitioned from the PolyAI agent.  
It performs:

`GET …/handoff_state?id={conversation_id}`

The returned data can then be used to:
- populate the agent desktop  
- route the interaction to the correct queue  
- enrich logs or CRM entries  
- maintain continuity between the automated and human-handled parts of the interaction

The endpoint is read-only and returns exactly the state stored by the PolyAI agent at the moment of handoff.
