The Concurrent Calls API lets you measure how many conversations your PolyAI agent is handling at the same time. It returns a time series of 5-minute intervals with the maximum number of concurrent conversations in each slice, filtered by environment, variant, language, and more.

This is useful for:
- capacity planning and concurrency limits
- monitoring usage during campaigns or spikes
- comparing traffic across variants or numbers

## Endpoint

`GET https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations/concurrency`

Where:
- region is one of: us-1, uk-1, euw-1
- account_id is your PolyAI account ID
- project_id is your PolyAI project ID


| Region | Base URL |
|-------:|----------|
| US     | https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app |
| UK     | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app |
| EUW    | https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app |


Example:
`GET https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app/v1/ACCOUNT-t53y16r3/PROJECT-f76d75c2/conversations/concurrency`

## Required query parameters

- `start_time`
  Start of the reporting window, in ISO8601 format. Rounded down to the nearest 5-minute mark.

- `end_time`
  End of the reporting window, in ISO8601 format. Rounded up to the nearest 5-minute mark.

start_time and end_time must be no more than one week apart.

## Optional filters

- `client_env`
  Filter by environment: sandbox, pre-release or live. Defaults to live.

- `variant_id` / `variant_name`
  Filter to a single variant by ID or name (only one may be supplied).

- `language`
  Filter to a specific language code (for example `en-GB`).

- `phone_number`
  Filter to a specific phone number.

## Slicing results

Use the `slice_by` parameter to break down the time series:

- `variant`
  Returns separate series per variant, with `variant_id` and `variant_name` populated.

- `language` or `phone_number`
  Supported in the interface, but currently not implemented (returns 501 Not Implemented).

When slice_by is set, each interval in the response includes additional context fields such as variant_id and variant_name.

## Authentication

All requests must include an API key in the x-api-key header. The key must be authorised for the Conversations and analytics endpoints for the specified account and project.

Example header:
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

## Response structure

On success, the API returns:

- `account_id`
  The account that was queried.

- `project_id`
  The project that was queried.

- `intervals`
  An array of 5-minute intervals in ascending chronological order. Each interval includes:
  - time: lower bound of the 5-minute window (UTC, ISO8601)
  - max_concurrent_conversations: maximum concurrent calls in that window after filters
  - variant_id and variant_name (when sliced by variant)
  - optional language or phone_number fields for future slicing support

You can use this time series to plot concurrency over time, to validate concurrency limits, or to correlate spikes with marketing campaigns and operational changes.

## Error handling

Typical error responses include:

- 400 Bad Request  
  Missing or invalid parameters (such as an invalid time range).

- 401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden  
  Missing, invalid, or unauthorised API key.

- 404 Not Found  
  Account or project not found.

- 500 or 501  
  Internal errors or unimplemented combinations such as `slice_by` set to `language` or `phone_number`.

Log the `error_message` field in the response body to help diagnose issues.
