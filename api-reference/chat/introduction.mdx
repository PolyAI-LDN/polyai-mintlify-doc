<Tip>Visit the [integrations](/integrations/web-chat/introduction) homepage if you are looking for more information on [Webchat integrations](/integrations/webchat/introduction).</Tip>

Use the Chat API to integrate PolyAI agents into existing <Tooltip tip="Non-voice chat systems, including live in-browser chats and widgets, as well as text and email conversations.">Webchat</Tooltip>
systems, and use its endpoints to get programmatic access to your automated chat interactions. This API structures non-voice web
integration conversations, messages, and chat sessions using a simple set of REST endpoints.

The Chat API can power multiple Webchat integrations, including [email](/integrations/webchat/email) and [in-app widgets](/integrations/webchat/in-app-chat).

## Chatting with the API

1. **Initiate conversation**: Send a POST `/chat/create` request with required headers.
2. **Send and receive messages**: Use the `/chat/respond` endpoint for ongoing interaction.
