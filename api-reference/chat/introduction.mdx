<Tip>Visit the [web chat](/webchat/introduction) homepage if you are looking for more information on chat integrations.</Tip>

Use the Chat API to integrate PolyAI agents into existing <Tooltip tip="Non-voice chat systems, including in-browser chats and widgets, as well as SMS and email conversations.">Webchat</Tooltip> systems, and use its endpoints to get programmatic access to automated chat interactions. This API structures non-voice web conversations, messages, and chat sessions using a simple set of REST endpoints.

The Chat API can power multiple Webchat integrations, including [WhatsApp](/integrations/web-chat/whatsapp), [email](/integrations/web-chat/email), and [in-app widgets](/integrations/web-chat/in-app-chat).

## Chatting with the API

1. **Start a conversation**
   Call `POST /{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/chat/create`.
   The response includes a `conversation_id` and the assistant’s initial `response`.
   > Per current schema, this endpoint has no request body.

2. **Send and receive messages**
   Call `POST /{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/chat/respond` with the `conversation_id`.
   `message` is optional. The response includes the assistant’s `response`, an `end_conversation` flag, and may include a `handoff` object.

3. **Close a conversation**
   Call `PUT /{version}/{account_id}/{project_id}/chat/close` with the `conversation_id` in the body.
   The response returns `{ "success": true }` on success.
