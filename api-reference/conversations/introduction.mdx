The Conversations API gives you programmatic access to structured conversation records generated by PolyAI agents. It provides historical transcripts, turn-by-turn metadata, handoff details, and performance metrics. This API is commonly used for analytics pipelines, compliance workflows, and internal BI systems.

The Conversations API is versioned. Each version reflects a stage in PolyAI’s data architecture: from the original cronjob-based ingestion system (v1) to the current event-sourced platform (v3).

<Tip>Most customers should use **v3**, the current supported version with the most complete and reliable data.</Tip>

## Conversations API versions

### v3 – current and recommended

v3 is the fully supported release of the Conversations API. It runs on PolyAI’s event-sourced data platform and offers:

- real-time, highly reliable ingestion
- consistent timestamp formatting
- empty strings ("") instead of null for empty text fields
- additional metadata fields such as latency, translated_user_input, and english_agent_response
- metrics and return fields configured through Agent Studio

Authentication for v3 is managed internally by PolyAI. Customers must request access through their PolyAI representative.

Example base path:

https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations

## Regional base URLs

| Region | Base URL |

| UK     | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app |
