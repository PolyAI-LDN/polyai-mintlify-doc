The Conversations API provides programmatic access to the conversation records generated by PolyAI agents. It returns transcripts, turn-by-turn metadata, handoff information, and performance metrics in a structured format suitable for analytics pipelines and integrations.

<Tip>Most customers should use v3, the latest most performant version.</Tip>

## API versions

Only the Conversations API is versioned. Other APIs are currently unversioned.

### v3 – current and recommended

v3 is the fully supported release of the Conversations API.
It runs on PolyAI’s event-sourced data platform and improves on v1 by offering:

- reliable, scalable ingestion and querying
- consistent ISO8601 timestamps
- empty strings ("") instead of null for empty text fields
- additional turn-level metadata such as latency, translated_user_input, and english_agent_response

Authentication for v3 is managed internally by PolyAI.
Customers must request v3 access through their PolyAI representative.

Example base path:

https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations

### v2

v2 uses the same schema and event-sourced backend as v3, but retains the legacy authentication model. Existing customers can continue using v2, but new customers should use v3

### v1 – legacy

v1 uses an earlier data pipeline and the legacy authentication system.

**Deprecation timeline**

- From **2 March 2026**, v1 moves to best-effort support (no SLA).
- From **31 August 2026**, v1 remains available but is no longer supported.

Customers on v1 should plan migration to v3 before support ends.

## Authentication

The Conversations API uses API key authentication.

### v3 keys

v3 keys are project- and region-scoped and are issued by PolyAI.
Your PolyAI representative will confirm the appropriate scope and provision access.

## Example: Retrieve a conversation (v3)

`GET https://api.{region}.platform.polyai.app/v3/{account_id}/{project_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}`

A successful response includes:

- complete turn-by-turn transcript
- consistent timestamps
- latency metrics
- translation outputs (when enabled)
- handoff metadata (if applicable)
