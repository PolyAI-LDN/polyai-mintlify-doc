At this stage, Jupiter is in a limited Beta mode, designed to provide insights into the capabilities of Generative AI assistants within a business context.

Jupiter is not yet equipped for deployment in enterprise-level sales environments. Our current version lacks certain key features, including:

- **API Integration**: The ability to perform API calls is not yet supported.

- **Telephony Integration**: Direct integration with Contact Center Software, or integration via SIP is currently pending.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Analytics tools for large-scale monitoring of agent performance are under development.

If your organization is looking to deploy advanced virtual assistants with a more comprehensive feature set, we encourage you to reach out to us. Our team is dedicated to tailoring solutions that align seamlessly with your enterprise needs.
