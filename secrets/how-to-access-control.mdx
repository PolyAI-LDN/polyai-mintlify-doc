Ensure the security of your secrets by implementing access control to restrict which assistants can access sensitive information. Follow these steps to manage access control for your secrets:

## Step 1: Accessing Secret Details Page

Navigate to the secret details page of the specific secret for which you want to manage access control. Here, you'll find various details about the secret, including its name, description, and value.

## Step 2: Managing Assistant Access

Scroll to the bottom of the secret details page, where you'll find the "Assistant access" section. Here, you can specify which assistant(s) should have access to this secret by selecting them from the available options.
