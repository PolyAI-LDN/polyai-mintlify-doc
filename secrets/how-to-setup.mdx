Follow these steps to securely create a new secret in the Secrets Vault:

## Step 1: Accessing Secrets Section

Navigate to the account landing page and locate the "Secrets" tab at the top alongside other tabs like Assistant, Billing, and Users. Click on the "Secrets" tab to proceed.

## Step 2: Secrets Main Page

Upon clicking the "Secrets" tab, you'll be directed to the main page of the Secrets section.

## Step 3: Adding a New Secret

On the top right corner of the page, you'll find the "Add secret" button. Click on this button to initiate the process of creating a new secret.

## Step 4: Providing Secret Details

A window will pop up where you can provide the necessary details for the new secret:

- **Name**: Enter the name for the secret.
- **Description** (Optional): Optionally add a description to explain its purpose.
- **Value**: Choose between storing the secret as a "Single" value (stored as a string) or key/value pairs (dictionary format expected upon retrieval).

## Step 5: Assigning Assistant Access

At the bottom of the window, you'll find the "Assistant access" field. Specify which assistant(s) should have access to this secret. Grant access to the relevant assistant(s) to ensure they can retrieve the secret when needed. Note that if access is not granted to an assistant here, it may not be able to retrieve the secret from the assistant editor page.

By following these steps, you can securely create and manage secrets within your account, ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized assistants.
