The **Response Controls** tab
enables you to regulate Assistant outputs by defining and managing specific keywords and phrases. These controls ensure appropriate
and on-brand interactions while preserving user experience.

## Key benefits

- **Enhanced safety**: Prevent the Assistant from generating inappropriate or off-brand responses.
- **Improved brand adherence**: Filter out responses that deviate from brand guidelines.
- **Operational efficiency**: Configure Response Controls directly in the PolyAI UI without backend modifications.
- **Custom metrics tracking**: Monitor and analyze Assistant behavior for better performance insights.

## How it works

Response Controls use string matching and regex patterns to monitor Assistant responses in real time. When a response matches a predefined stop keyword or phrase, the system can:
1. **Halt the response**: Immediately stop response generation.
2. **Log the occurrence**: Track matches for analytics and review.

This functionality helps ensure adherence to safety and brand standards without disrupting the flow of conversations.

## Getting started

### Accessing Response Controls settings

1. **Navigate to Response Controls**: Access the settings from the **[Response controls page](/response-control/introduction)**.
2. **Create a new phrase**:
   - Click **Add Phrase** to open the creation form.
   - Fill out the required fields:
     - **ID**: A unique identifier for tracking the stop keyword.
     - **Description**: (Optional) Describe the purpose of the stop keyword for team understanding.
     - **Regular Expression**: Enter a regex pattern to define the keyword or phrase.
     - **Say Phrases**: Toggle to determine whether matching phrases halt the response (TRUE) or are tracked for analytics (FALSE).

## Feature details

### Response Controls structure

Response Controls are organized as **Stop Keywords**, each with specific attributes:

- **ID (String)**: Unique identifier for tracking and analytics.
- **Description (String)**: Optional text to clarify the keyword's purpose.
- **Regular Expression (String)**: Regex pattern that identifies the phrases or words to control.
- **Say Phrases (Boolean)**: Specifies whether matching phrases halt responses (TRUE) or are logged for analysis (FALSE).

### Stop keywords

Use stop keywords to ensure your assistants react quickly and appropriately to sensitive information or inappropriate conversations.

<Tab title="1. Create a function">
![control](/images/stop_keywords_function.png)
Navigate to the [Functions](/function/introduction) section under the Build tab to define a custom function for handling stop keywords.

**Example setup**:
- **Name**: ashmolean
- **Description**: Respond when stop keywords are detected.
- **Type**: String
- **Function definition**:

```python
def ashmolean(conv: Conversation):
    return "The detected phrase is restricted. Please adjust your input."
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="2. Configure the keyword">
![control](/images/stop_keywords_response_control.png)
Next, navigate to the **Response Controls** section and add a new stop keyword.

**Setup details**:
- **ID**: Ashmolean
- **Description**: Restrict responses containing the word "Ashmolean."
- **Regular Expression**: `\bashmolean\b`
- **Say Phrases**: `TRUE` (to halt responses when detected).
- **Action**: Link to the `ashmolean` function.

</Tab>

<Tab title="3. Test">
![control](/images/stop_keywords_test.png)
Go to the **Web Chat** testing panel to validate your setup.

**Steps**:
1. Type a message containing the word "Ashmolean."
2. Observe the assistant's response: "The detected phrase is restricted. Please adjust your input."
3. Confirm that the assistant halts any further response generation.

**Expected result**:
The assistant successfully identifies the stop keyword, triggers the linked function, and stops further dialogue.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Example configuration

**ID:** `stop_inappropriate`
**Description:** Prevent responses containing offensive language.
**Regular Expression:** `/\b(offensiveWord1|offensiveWord2)\b/i`
**Say Phrases:** `TRUE`

This setup ensures responses containing "offensiveWord1" or "offensiveWord2" are immediately halted.

### Advanced configuration

You can use regex to define complex patterns for fine-grained control over responses. For a detailed guide on regex, refer to **[Regex documentation](https://regex101.com/)**.

## Custom metrics tracking

Response Controls log all occurrences of matches for analytics. You can view these metrics in the **[Analytics Dashboard](/analytics/dashboards/introduction)** to identify trends, evaluate Assistant behavior, and refine controls over time.

## Practical use cases

- **Safety compliance**: Prevent offensive or harmful language in user interactions.
- **Brand adherence**: Block responses with phrases outside approved messaging.
- **Content moderation**: Identify and log responses that require review or adjustment.
