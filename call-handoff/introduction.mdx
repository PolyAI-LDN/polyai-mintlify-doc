Use **Call Handoffs** to define destinations for customer-call routing. The typical use case for a handoff is
a scenario where the assistant cannot handle a query where a live, human agent is required.

### Adding a handoff destination

To create a new handoff destination:

1. Navigate to the **Call Handoffs** section in the **Build** menu.
2. Click **Add Handoff**.
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Handoff destination name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Front desk").
   - **Extension / Number**: Provide the phone number or extension to route the call.
   - **Description**: Add a note about when to use this handoff (e.g., "When the call needs help with a broader topic").
4. Click **Add** to save the destination.

### Using your own Twilio number

If you're bringing your own Twilio phone number to route calls, follow these steps to integrate it as a handoff destination:

1. **Connect your Twilio account**:
   - Ensure your [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/login) is set up and you have the necessary credentials ([Account SID](https://help.twilio.com/articles/14726256820123-What-is-a-Twilio-Account-SID-and-where-can-I-find-it-), [Auth Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/authtoken)).
   - Navigate to the [Telephony](/telephony/introduction) section in the platform.
   - Enter your Twilio credentials to connect your account securely.

2. **Assign a Twilio number**:
   - Choose a number from your Twilio account to use for routing calls.
   - If necessary, provision new numbers directly using the Twilio console.

3. **Set up routing in Twilio**:
   - Configure your Twilio number to route calls to your PolyAI assistant by setting the **Webhook URL** in your Twilio console. For example:
     - **Voice Webhook URL**: `https://your-polyai-instance-url/voice/call`
   - Make sure your webhook supports **POST** requests and uses the correct authentication methods.

4. **Add the Twilio number as a handoff destination**:
   - In the **Call Handoffs** section, use the Twilio number as the "Extension / Number" field when creating a new destination.
   - Add a description specifying its purpose (e.g., "Route to Twilio-based live agent team").

### Managing handoffs

Once a handoff destination is created, it will appear in the list of destinations. You can edit, delete, or update the details as needed.

- **Example**: A museum assistant might have a handoff destination called "School visits" to transfer calls related to group bookings or educational inquiries.

### Best practices for call handoffs

- **Clear descriptions**: Use descriptive names and notes to ensure accurate call routing.
- **Fallback options**: Set a default handoff destination as a fallback to handle any unclassified transfers.
- **Test routes**: Regularly test handoff destinations to confirm that they function correctly.
- **Secure Twilio credentials**: Ensure your Twilio credentials are stored securely and have restricted access to prevent unauthorized usage.

By using the **Call Handoffs** section and integrating Twilio effectively, you can streamline call routing for both your customers and live agents.
