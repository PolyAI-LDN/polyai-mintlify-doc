The **Call Handoffs** section allows you to define destinations that calls can be routed to during conversations. This
is useful for scenarios where the assistant cannot handle a query and needs to transfer the call to a specific live agent or team.

### Adding a handoff destination

To create a new handoff destination:

1. Navigate to the **Call Handoffs** section in the **Build** menu.
2. Click **Add Handoff**.
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Handoff destination name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Front desk").
   - **Extension / Number**: Provide the phone number or extension to route the call.
   - **Description**: Add a note about when to use this handoff (e.g., "When the call needs help with a broader topic").
4. Click **Add** to save the destination.

### Managing handoffs

Once a handoff destination is created, it will appear in the list of destinations. You can edit, delete, or update the details as needed.

- **Example**: A museum assistant might have a handoff destination called "School visits" to transfer calls related to group bookings or educational inquiries.

### Best practices for call handoffs

- **Clear descriptions**: Use descriptive names and notes to ensure accurate call routing.
- **Fallback options**: Set a default handoff destination as a fallback to handle any unclassified transfers.
- **Test routes**: Regularly test handoff destinations to confirm that they function correctly.
