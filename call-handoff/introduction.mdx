Use **Call Handoffs** to define destinations for customer-call routing. The typical use case for a handoff is a scenario where the agent cannot handle a query and a live, human agent is required.

### Adding a handoff destination

To create a new handoff destination:

1. Navigate to the **Call Handoffs** section in the **Build** menu.
2. Click **Add Handoff**.
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Front desk").
   - **Description**: Add a note about when to use this handoff (e.g., "When the caller needs to speak with an operator").
   - **Method**: Choose the SIP method to use for call routing. Options include:
     - **[SIP REFER](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3515.txt)** (default) – Transfers the call to an external number or SIP URI.
     - **[SIP INVITE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-13.3.1)** – Directly places a new call.
     - **[SIP BYE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3261.html)** – Ends an ongoing call.
   - **Route**: Specify the destination SIP URI or extension.
   - **SIP headers**: Add optional **[SIP headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml)** to include metadata or routing instructions.

4. Click **Add** to save the destination.

### Configuring SIP headers

SIP headers can be used to send additional metadata when making a handoff. To add SIP headers:

1. Click **Add SIP Header** in the handoff setup modal.
2. Enter a **Header Name** (e.g., `Call-ID`).
3. Enter a **Value** (e.g., `abc123`).
4. Repeat as needed for multiple headers.

SIP headers allow for custom integrations with external telephony systems and can help manage call behavior dynamically.

### Managing handoffs

Once a handoff destination is created, it will appear in the list of destinations. You can edit, delete, or update the details as needed.

- **Example**: A customer support agent might have a handoff destination called "Billing Support" to route calls related to payment issues.

### Best practices for call handoffs

- **Use clear descriptions**: Ensure handoffs are labeled with their intended use to avoid confusion.
- **Test call routing**: Regularly test handoff destinations to verify they are functioning correctly.
- **Optimize SIP headers**: Use headers to pass relevant metadata and improve call handling.
- **Ensure fallback coverage**: Set up a default handoff destination in case a primary route fails.
