Use **Call Handoffs** to define destinations for customer-call routing. The typical use case for a handoff is a scenario where the agent cannot handle a query and a live, human agent is required.

### Adding a handoff destination

To create a new handoff destination:

1. Navigate to the **Call Handoffs** section in the **Build** menu.
2. Click **Add Handoff**.
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Front desk").
   - **Description**: Add a note about when to use this handoff (e.g., "When the caller needs to speak with an operator").
   - **Method**: Choose the SIP method to use for call routing. Options include:
     - **[SIP REFER](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3515.txt)** (default) – PolyAI specifies a transfer destination to the client <Tooltip tip="This is a network element that manages and secures SIP calls. SBCs handle call routing, security, and interoperability between different VoIP networks.">Session Border Controller</Tooltip> (SBC), then drops from the call.
     - **[SIP INVITE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-13.3.1)** – PolyAI creates a new call with the destination and acts as a bridge between the client SBC and the destination.
     - **[SIP BYE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3261.html)** – PolyAI signals that its call leg is over, allowing the client SBC to take the call back over.
   - **Route**: Specify the destination SIP URI or extension (only applies to SIP INVITE and SIP REFER).
   - **SIP headers**: Add optional **[SIP headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml)** to include metadata or routing instructions.

4. Click **Add** to save the destination.

### Configuring SIP headers

SIP headers can be used to send additional metadata when making a handoff. To add SIP headers:

1. Click **Add SIP Header** in the handoff setup modal.
2. Enter a **Header Name** (e.g., X-Customer-ID).
   - Custom headers should start with an `X-` prefix.
3. Enter a **Value** (e.g., `abc123`).
4. You can use `$variables` in the SIP header values for dynamic data. Example:

   `X-Caller-ID: $caller_id`

5. Repeat as needed for multiple headers.

SIP headers allow for custom integrations with external telephony systems and can help manage call behavior dynamically.

### Managing handoffs

Once a handoff destination is created, it will appear in the list of destinations. You can edit, delete, or update the details as needed.

- **Example**: A customer support agent might have a handoff destination called "Billing Support" to route calls related to payment issues.

### Best practices for call handoffs

- **Use clear descriptions**: Ensure handoffs are labeled with their intended use to avoid confusion.
- **Test call routing**: Regularly test handoff destinations to verify they are functioning correctly.
- **Optimize SIP headers**: Use headers to pass relevant metadata and improve call handling.

### Using your own Twilio number

If you're bringing your own Twilio phone number to route calls, follow these steps to integrate it as a handoff destination:

1. **Connect your Twilio account**:
   - Ensure your [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/login) is set up and you have the necessary credentials ([Account SID](https://help.twilio.com/articles/14726256820123-What-is-a-Twilio-Account-SID-and-where-can-I-find-it-), [Auth Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/authtoken)).
   - Navigate to the [Telephony](/telephony/introduction) section in the Agent Studio.
   - Enter your Twilio credentials to connect your account securely.

2. **Assign a Twilio number**:
   - Choose a number from your Twilio account to use for routing calls.
   - If necessary, provision new numbers directly using the Twilio console.

3. **Set up routing in Twilio**:
   - Configure your Twilio number to route calls to your PolyAI agent by setting the **Webhook URL** in your Twilio console. Example:
     - **Voice Webhook URL**: `https://your-polyai-instance-url/voice/call`
   - Make sure your webhook supports **POST** requests and uses the correct authentication methods.

4. **Add the Twilio number as a handoff destination**:
   - In the **Call Handoffs** section, use the Twilio number as the "Extension / Number" field when creating a new destination.
   - Add a description specifying its purpose (e.g., "Route to Twilio-based live agent team").

### Important for US Numbers: Register for A2P 10DLC**
If you are using a US-based Twilio number, you must [register for A2P 10DLC](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/a2p-10dlc#who-needs-to-register-for-a2p-10dlc) to comply with regulatory requirements. Twilio will block SMS messages if this is not completed.

#### Register
1. **Go to Twilio's A2P 10DLC registration page:**
   [Twilio A2P 10DLC Registration Guide](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260800720410-What-is-A2P-10DLC-)
2. **Complete brand and campaign registration** to comply with US carrier regulations.
3. **Wait for approval** (can take a few days).
4. **Once approved**, messages will send successfully.

## Comparison: Call Handoff and the `transfer_call` function

These two methods serve similar purposes — routing the user to another endpoint — but are mutually exclusive and differ in flexibility and implementation.

| Feature                         | `Call Handoff` (UI-based)                          | `transfer_call` (code-based)                          |

| Dynamic routing logic           | —                                                 | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Full control   |

| Supports soft-handoff           | —                                                 | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" />                |
| Best for static SIP integration | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" />            | —                                                      |
| Best for dynamic integrations   | —                                                 | <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> (e.g. Zendesk) |

<Note>
These two methods **cannot be used together** in the same step. If you're using `transfer_call` in a [function](/function/introduction), it overrides any configured Call Handoff in the UI.
</Note>

### When to use each method

Use `Call Handoff` if:
- You want a quick setup through Agent Studio with minimal code.
- Your routing needs are straightforward and based on static values.

Use `transfer_call` if:
- You need to pass dynamic SIP headers (e.g., customer metadata).
- You want to use soft handoffs or log custom handoff metrics.
- You’re integrating with a platform that doesn’t support SIP REFER (e.g. Zendesk).

**Troubleshooting:** If your messages fail to send, check the Twilio logs for these error codes:
- [**30034** - Unregistered Number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30034)
- [**30035** - Number Still Being Configured](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30035)
