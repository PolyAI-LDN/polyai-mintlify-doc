Use the **Delay control** panel to improve the user experience when a function takes longer than expected. Inserting a transition utterances while the function is still processing and prevent long silences, making interactions feel more natural and responsive.

## Key benefits

- **Keep users engaged:** Provide real-time feedback rather than leaving users waiting in silence.
- **Fully configurable timing:** Control when and how often delay responses play.
- **Supports multiple utterances:** Define a sequence of responses to use as interim messages.
- **Works across different function types:** Available for global functions and flow functions, but not for start or end functions.

## How it works

1. **Define delay responses**
   - Create a list of phrases that the assistant can say while waiting for a function to complete.
   - These could include simple confirmations, status updates, or even sound effects like 'keyboard typing.'

2. **Configure delay timing**
   - Set the initial delay before the first utterance plays.
   - Define the interval between subsequent utterances to control pacing.

3. **Specify utterance length**
   - For sound-based responses (e.g., typing noises), specify the expected duration so the system can calculate accurate timing.

## Example scenario

A restaurant booking system uses delay control for a function that takes a few seconds to confirm a reservation.

1. The user requests a table.
2. The assistant acknowledges: *'Let me check availability for you.'*
3. While the function is running, it plays: *'Just a moment, Iâ€™m still checking.'*
4. Once complete, the assistant confirms: *'Your table is booked!'*

## Using delay controls in the agent studio

- Navigate to the **Functions** and select a function.
- Open the **Delay control** panel.
- Add one or more delay responses.
- Set the initial delay and interval between responses.
- Optionally, specify the length of sound-based utterances.
- Save changes and test in the chat panel to experience the timing adjustments in real-time.
