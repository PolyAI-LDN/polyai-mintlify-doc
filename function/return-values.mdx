title: Return values
---

When creating functions, you can specify return values to control the agent's behavior dynamically. The return value can either be a string or a dictionary containing specific fields to guide the virtual agent.

### String return

You can return a simple string, which will be used as the system prompt for the virtual agent:

```python
return "Tell the caller that you cannot assist with their request"
```

### Dictionary return

<Warning> This feature is experimental and may change without warning. </Warning>

Alternatively, you can return a dictionary to specify more detailed and deterministic instructions. The following fields can be used individually or in combination:

#### `content`

Equivalent to returning a string, this field specifies the system prompt:

```python
return {
  "content": "Tell the caller that you cannot assist with their request"
}
```

#### `utterance`

Specifies the exact phrase the virtual agent will speak after executing the function:

```python
return {
  "utterance": "I cannot assist with your request."
}
```

**Note**: If both `content` and `utterance` are returned:
- The agent will stream the `utterance` to the user and end the turn.
- The `content` rules will apply to the next turn.

#### `handoff`

Initiates a call handoff after the function executes. This follows the format of a handoff object:

```python
return {
  "handoff": {
    "type": "CALL_CENTER",
    "reason": "SPEAK_TO",
    "refer": {
      "phone_number": "12345"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `invite`

Hands the call off using a SIP INVITE. Configuration fields depend on project telephony integration requirements:

```python
return {
  "handoff": {
    "invite": {
      "phone_number": "<eg: 2222222>",
      "outbound_caller_id": conv.caller_number,
      "outbound_endpoint": "<ADD_YOUR_OUTBOUND_ENDPOINT_NAME>",
      "sip_headers": {
        "X-ANY_HEADER_NAME": "header"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `hangup`

Ends the call after the function executes:

```python
return {
  "hangup": True
}
```

## `listen` Return Object

Configures the agent to listen on the next turn.

<Tip>To use `asr.timeout`, you must include an `utterance`. Without it, the timeout won’t apply.</Tip>

```json
return {
  "utterance": "Can I help you with anything else?",
  "listen": {
    "asr": {
      "timeout": 20
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>ASR timeout doesn’t apply to DTMF-only input. If using both channels, make sure you include an `utterance` so the ASR settings take effect.</Note>

#### `variant`

Switches the conversation to a different variant:

```python
return {
  "variant": "orleans"
}
```
