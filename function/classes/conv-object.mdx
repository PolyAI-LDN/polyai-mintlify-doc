The `Conversation` object (`conv`) provides access to conversation data and tools for managing the agent's behavior. It handles state management, flow transitions, SMS interactions, environment details, and voice selection.

## Attributes

The `conv` object includes the following attributes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="env">
    **Description**: Identifies the current [environment](/environments-and-versions/introduction) where the agent is running.

    **Values**:
    - `"sandbox"`: For testing new features.
    - `"pre-release"`: For staging and quality assurance.
    - `"live"`: For production environments.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    if conv.env == "live":
        print("Agent is live!")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="sip_headers">
    **Description**: A dictionary of [SIP headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7131) with metadata about the caller.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    caller_id = conv.sip_headers.get("From", "Unknown Caller")
    print("Caller ID:", caller_id)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="caller_number">
    **Description**: The caller's phone number.

    **Type**: Optional string

    **Example**:
    ```python
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/users?number={conv.caller_number}")
    user = response.json()
    conv.state.user = user
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="callee_number">
    **Description**: The number the caller dialed.

    **Type**: Optional string

    **Example**:
    ```python
    if conv.callee_number == "+15551234567":
        conv.state.branch = "Main Branch"
    else:
        conv.state.branch = "Other Branch"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="state">
    **Description**: A dictionary-like object for storing variables during the conversation. Use it to maintain context across function calls. See the [variable feature page](./variables) for details.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    conv.state.num_calls = 1
    conv.state.responses = {
        1: "This is your first call.",
        2: "This is your second call."
    }

    num_calls = conv.state.num_calls
    conv.state.num_calls += 1
    return conv.state.responses[num_calls]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Methods

The `conv` object includes the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="randomize_voice">
    **Description**: Assigns a voice to the agent based on predefined weights. This allows an agent to use multiple voices, simulating a team of agents. For more information, visit the [multi-voice guide](/voice/multi-voice).

    **Args**:
    - `voices` (list): A list of `VoiceWeighting` objects specifying the voices and their weights.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    conv.randomize_voice([
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=ElevenLabsVoice(
                voice_id="LcfCDJNUPlGQjkzn1xUU",
                similarity_boost=0.2,
                stability=0.4
            ),
            weight=0.5
        ),
        VoiceWeighting(
            voice=ElevenLabsVoice(
                voice_id="SOYHLrjzKX21zeoPC6cr",
                similarity_boost=0.7,
                stability=0.3
            ),
            weight=0.5
        )
    ])
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="goto_flow">
    **Description**: Moves the conversation to a specific flow.

    **Args**:
    - `flow_name` (str): The name of the target flow.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    conv.goto_flow("support_flow")
    if conv.state.should_switch_flow:
        conv.goto_flow("escalation_flow")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="exit_flow">
    **Description**: Leaves the current flow and resumes the default behavior.

    **Example**:
    ```python
    conv.exit_flow()
    ```
  </Accordion>
