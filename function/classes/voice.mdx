The PolyAI platform supports flexible voice selection, including built-in voices and external providers such as ElevenLabs, AWS Polly,
and Microsoft Azure TTS.

## Quick voice selection with Voices enum

For simple use cases, you can assign voices using the built-in `Voices` enum:

```python
from polyai.voice import Voices

conv.set_voice(Voices.en_female_warm)
```

These voices are hosted and maintained by PolyAI.

## Advanced voice control with provider classes

For finer control — such as picking models, adjusting stability, or accessing third-party providers — use provider-specific `TTSVoice` classes:

### Example: ElevenLabs

```python
from polyai.voice import ElevenLabsVoice

conv.set_voice(
    ElevenLabsVoice(
        provider_voice_id="gDnGxUcsitTxRiGHr904",
        model_id="eleven_flash_v2",
        stability=0.5,
        similarity_boost=0.7,
    )
)
```

### Example: AWS Polly

```python
from polyai.voice import PollyVoice

conv.set_voice(
    PollyVoice(
        provider_voice_id="Joanna",
        engine="neural",
    )
)
```

### Example: Microsoft Azure TTS

```python
from polyai.voice import AzureVoice

conv.set_voice(
    AzureVoice(
        provider_voice_id="en-US-JennyNeural",
        style="cheerful",
        role="customer-service-rep"
    )
)
```

## Cache behavior
* Changing `model_id` does not automatically invalidate cached audio.
* To reset [cached audio](/audio-management/introduction):
    * Go to **Audio > Cache** and delete existing entries.
	* Or, create a new voice entry with a different `voice_id`.
	* You can prepend model ID to voice ID (e.g. `eleven_flash_v2/a1b2c3`...) if you want to isolate caches across models.
