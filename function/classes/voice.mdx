The PolyAI platform supports flexible voice selection for external providers such as ElevenLabs, AWS Polly,
and Microsoft Azure TTS.

## Provider classes

When picking models, adjusting stability, or accessing third-party providers — use provider-specific TTSVoice classes.
You can also optionally adjust **clarity** and **latency_mode** to match the agent’s interaction style.

### Example: ElevenLabs

```python
from polyai.voice import ElevenLabsVoice

conv.set_voice(
    ElevenLabsVoice(
        provider_voice_id="gDnGxUcsitTxRiGHr904",
        model_id="eleven_flash_v2",
        stability=0.5,
        similarity_boost=0.7,
        clarity=0.8,            # Optional: controls crispness of enunciation
        latency_mode="swift",   # Optional: aligns with interaction-style settings
    )
)
```

### Example: AWS Polly

from polyai.voice import PollyVoice

```python
conv.set_voice(
    PollyVoice(
        provider_voice_id="Joanna",
        engine="neural",
        clarity=0.6,
    )
)
```

### Example: Microsoft Azure TTS

```python
from polyai.voice import AzureVoice

conv.set_voice(
    AzureVoice(
        provider_voice_id="en-US-JennyNeural",
        style="cheerful",
        role="customer-service-rep",
        clarity=0.9,
    )
)
```

## Cache behavior

* Changing `model_id` does not automatically invalidate cached audio.
* To reset [cached audio](/audio-management/introduction):
  * Go to **Audio → Cache** and delete existing entries.
  * Or, create a new voice entry with a different voice_id.
  * You can prepend the model ID to the voice ID (e.g. `eleven_flash_v2/a1b2c3...`) if you want to isolate caches across models.

## Additional options

- **clarity** – fine-tunes articulation sharpness per utterance (0.0–1.0).
- **latency_mode** – chooses a response profile ("swift", "balanced", "precise", "turbo") consistent with [Interaction style](/audio-management/introduction#interaction-style).
- **stability** – controls tone variability across runs.
- **randomize_voice()** – supports external providers for weighted selection.
