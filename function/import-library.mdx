### Standard library

Within functions you have access to all of the standard Python libraries, docs for which can be found below.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html

### Non-standard library

We also include the non-standard `requests` library in order to make it easy to make API requests. Docs can be found below.

Apart from built-in library coming with Python 3.9, you can also import the following library in your python function body:

- [requests==2.28.2](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.28.2/)
- [decorator==4.4.2](https://pypi.org/project/decorator/4.4.2/)
