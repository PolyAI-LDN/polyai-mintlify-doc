title: 'Conversation'
---

The `Conversation` object exposes useful information about the current state of the conversation and utilities for controlling conversation
flow. This includes the environment, SIP headers, the current flow, caller and callee phone numbers, and the conversation state, where you
can store custom variables that persist throughout the conversation.

### Properties:

### `env`:

```python
@property
def env(self) -> str:

## Usage

if conv.env == "sandbox":
	return "Hello, sandbox"
```

- **Description**: Returns the client environment this conversation is in.
- **Type**: `str`

### `sip_headers`:

```python
@property
def sip_headers(self) -> Dict[str, str]:

# Usage

hotel = conv.sip_headers["X-Hotel"]
if hotel:
	conv.state.hotel = hotel
if hotel in ["The Ritz", "The Mayfair Hotel"]:
	conv.state.posh = True
```

- **Description**: Returns a dictionary mapping SIP header names to their corresponding values.
- **Type**: `Dict[str, str]`

### `caller_number`:

```python
@property
def caller_number(self) -> Optional[str]:

# Usage

import requests

response = requests.get(f"test.api.com/users?number={conv.caller_number}")
response.raise_for_status()

user = response.json()
conv.state.user = user
```

- **Description**: Returns the caller's phone number.
- **Type**: `Optional[str]`

### `callee_number`:

```python
@property
def callee_number(self) -> Optional[str]:

# Usage

hotel_number = conv.callee_number
if hotel_number == "07890987756":
	conv.state.hotel = "Poly Hotel"
else:
	conv.state.hotel = "Other Hotel"
```

- **Description**: Returns the callee (the call recipient)'s phone number.
- **Type**: `Optional[str]`

### `state`:

```python
@property
def state(self) -> State:

# Usage

# Start function
conv.state.num_func_calls = 1
conv.state.responses = {
	1: "You are the first function call, you can make more.",
	2: "You are the second function call, you can make more.",
	3: "You are the third function call, you cannot make anymore.",
}

# Subsequent function calls
num_calls = conv.state.num_func_calls
conv.state.num_func_calls += 1
return conv.state.responses[num_calls]
```

- **Description**: Returns a `State` object representing a dictionary of variables that persist through the conversation. This object supports both dictionary-style indexing (e.g., `conv.state["key"] = "value"`) and dot syntax for attribute access (e.g., `conv.state.key = "value"`).
- **Tip:** You should make sure you always check that your state variable has been instantiated before trying to do anything with it, otherwise you might encounter errors if the functions are called out of order.

### `current_flow`:

```python
@property
def current_flow(self) -> Optional[str]:

# Usage

if conv.current_flow != "function flow":
	return "You should not call this function outside of 'function flow' flow"
```

- **Description**: Returns the name of the flow that the conversation is currently in, or `None` if no flow is active.
- **Type**: `Optional[str]`

### Methods:

### `goto_flow`:

```python
def goto_flow(self, flow_name: str):

# Usage

conv.goto_flow("Test flow")
if conv.state.should_go_to_another_flow:
	# We will go to "Another flow" because we only listen to the last
	# invocation of this function.
	conv.goto_flow("Another flow")
```

- **Description**: Triggers a transition to a new flow using the target flow name. This will enter the conversation into the flow state at the flows start step. 
This does not need to be returned from the function, however it should be noted that the last call of this function is the one which will take effect.
- **Args**:
    - `flow_name` (`str`): The name of the flow to transition into.

### `exit_flow`:

```python
def exit_flow(self):

# Usage

conv.exit_flow()
```

- **Description**: Exits the current flow.
