title: 'Variables'
---

Variables are defined by setting a property on the `conv.state` object within a function. You can choose a name for your variable
and update its value to anything you want like so:

```python
conv.state.my_variable = 1
conv.state.my_other_variable = {
    "property": "value"
}
```

These variables will retain their state between turns of the conversation and can be referenced in subsequent function calls like so:

```python
if conv.state.my_variable == 10:
    return "Well done you hit 10"
```

### Prompt templating

Variables can be used within function calls and injected dynamically into prompts shown to the LLM. To inject a variable's value
into your prompt, use the syntax `$variable_name`. The system will replace this placeholder with the variable's value wherever it matches.

**Example:**

In your start function, you can write:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def start_function(conv: Conversation):
    conv.state.current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
```

**...then in your prompting:**

The current date is `$current_date`.

**...becomes:**

The current date is September 06, 2024.

When using variable templating, ensure the stored value is readable by the LLM. Complex objects like dictionaries or datetime
will be stringified automatically.

### Environment configuration

You can use the `conv.env` property to define environment-specific platform functions and activate test features in sandbox or
pre-release environments.

For example:

```python
if conv.env == "sandbox":
    <enable_early_feedback_flow>
elif conv.env == "pre-release":
    <activate_staging_tools>
elif conv.env == "live":
    <run_production_features>
```

### Dynamic updates

The value templated into the prompt is always kept up to date, so any updates will be reflected in the next turn sent to the LLM.

**Example:**

```python
from datetime import datetime

def set_fake_date(conv: Conversation):
    conv.state.current_date = datetime(1995, 3, 22).date().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
```

After running this function, the resulting prompt would display:

The current date is March 22, 1995.

...in the next turn.

### Deleting a variable

To delete a variable, remove it from the state within a function:

```python
del conv.state['variable_name']
```
