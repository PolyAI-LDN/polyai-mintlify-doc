You can use custom classes in your functions to manage voice configuration and
conversation states.

## `Conversation`

The `Conversation` class is a core component of function execution, and is used for managing information during the conversation runtime.

<Tip> For full details on using the `Conversation` class, including **attributes** and **methods**, visit the [`conv` object](classes/conv-object) page. </Tip>

```python
def get_conversation_id(conv: Conversation):
    return conv.id
```

## `VoiceWeighting`

Read the [multi-voice](/voice/multi-voice) document if you are unfamiliar with voice weighting.

The `VoiceWeighting` class allows you to assign specific weightings to voices, adjusting their prominence in a given context.

```python
VoiceWeighting(
      voice=ElevenLabsVoice(
        provider_voice_id="LcfcDJNUP1GQjkzn1xUU",
        similarity_boost=0.2,
        stability=0.4
      ),
      weight=0.25
    )
```

## `ElevenLabsVoice`

The `ElevenLabsVoice` class configures voice settings for [ElevenLabs](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api-reference/voices) TTS system, allowing control over stability and similarity to the reference voice.

```python
elevenlabs_voice = ElevenLabsVoice(
    provider_voice_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    stability=0.5,
    similarity_boost=0.7
)
```

Parameters:
- `provider_voice_id`: Specifies the ElevenLabs voice to use.
- `stability`: Controls the consistency of tone and delivery (0.0 to 1.0).
- `similarity_boost`: Controls how closely the generated voice matches the original (0.0 to 1.0).

## `PlayHTVoice`

The `PlayHTVoice` class configures voice settings for [PlayHT](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-getting-started) TTS system, allowing selection of a specific voice ID and style.

```python
playht_voice = PlayHTVoice(
    provider_voice_id="en_us_male_1",
    style="conversational"
)
```

Parameters:
- `provider_voice_id`: Specifies the PlayHT voice to use.
- `style`: Defines the speaking style or tone.

## `RimeVoice`

The `RimeVoice` class configures voice settings for [Rime](https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/voices) TTS system, allowing selection of a specific provider voice ID.

```python
rime_voice = RimeVoice(
    provider_voice_id="s3://path-to-manifest.json",
    style="neutral",
    speed_alpha=1.0
)
```

Parameters:
- `provider_voice_id`: This is an **S3 path to a manifest file** that contains the voice configuration.
- `speed_alpha`: Controls the speech rate multiplier (e.g., 1.0 is normal speed).

## `CartesiaVoice`

The `CartesiaVoice` class configures voice settings for [Cartesia](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/tts/tts) TTS system, allowing fine-tuned voice synthesis.

```python
cartesia_voice = CartesiaVoice(
    provider_voice_id="cartesia_ai_voice",
    pitch=1.1,
    rate=0.9,
    language="en",
    emotion="neutral"
)
```

Parameters:
- `provider_voice_id`: Specifies the Cartesia voice to use.
- `pitch`: Adjusts the pitch of the voice.
- `rate`: Controls the speed of speech.
- `language`: Sets the language code for synthesis (e.g., "en" for English).
- `emotion`: Allows setting the emotional tone of the speech.

## `CustomVoice`

The `CustomVoice` class is used for defining voice configurations that use a custom TTS provider. This allows you to override the default system voice with a provider-supported voice.

```python
voice_config = CustomVoice(provider="my_tts_provider", id="Emma")
```

Parameters:
- `provider`: Specifies the custom TTS provider.
- `id`: Specifies the voice ID within the custom provider.

This update ensures that **all TTS providers have full parameter details**, with links included directly the first time a provider is mentioned. Let me know if any refinements are needed! ðŸš€
