Use PolyAI's custom classes in your Agent Studio functions to manage voice interactions and
conversation states, control voice settings, and set flows in motion.

## `Conversation`

The `Conversation` class is a core component of function execution, and is used for managing information during the conversation runtime.

<Tip> For full details on using the `Conversation` class, including **attributes** and **methods**, visit the [`conv` object](classes/conv-object) object. </Tip>

```python
def get_conversation_id(conv: Conversation):
    return conv.id
```

## `VoiceWeighting`

Read the [multi-voice](/voice/multi-voice) document if you are unfamiliar with voice weighting.

The `VoiceWeighting` class allows you to assign specific weightings to voices, adjusting their prominence in a given context.

```python
voice_preference = VoiceWeighting(provider_voice_id="EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL", weight=0.7)
```

## `ElevenLabsVoice`

The `ElevenLabsVoice` class configures voice settings for ElevenLabs' TTS system, allowing control over [stability and similarity](/audio-management/introduction) to the reference voice.

```python
elevenlabs_voice = ElevenLabsVoice(
    provider_voice_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    stability=0.5,
    similarity_boost=0.7
)
```

## `PlayHTVoice`

The `PlayHTVoice` class configures voice settings for PlayHT's TTS system, allowing selection of a specific voice ID and style.

```python
playht_voice = PlayHTVoice(
    provider_voice_id="en_us_male_1",
    style="conversational"
)
```

## `CustomVoice`

The `CustomVoice` class is used for defining voice configurations that use a custom TTS provider. This allows you to override the default system
voice with a provider-supported voice.

```python
voice_config = CustomVoice(provider="my_tts_provider", id="Emma")
```
