title: 'Start function'
---

The **Start Function** is executed immediately when a conversation begins, ensuring that the assistant is fully prepared to handle user interactions.
It runs synchronously, meaning the greeting message will not be played until the Start Function has completed its tasks. This function is
essential for setting up key context and initializing the conversation state.

## Key features and functionality

1. **Synchronous execution**: Ensures the setup process is complete before the conversation begins.
2. **Customizable initialization**: Allows for dynamic setup tailored to the specific use case.
3. **Context preparation**: Gathers and stores data that informs subsequent steps in the conversation.

## Use cases

The **Start Function**:

### 1. **Reads SIP headers**
   - Capture metadata like caller ID, call origin, or telephony-specific information.
   - Example use case: Determine the hotel site or business branch the call is directed to based on telephony headers.

### 2. **Retrieves date and time**
   - Initialize state with the current date, time, or day of the week for timestamping or scheduling logic.
   - Example use case: Preload available time slots for scheduling queries or confirm user-requested dates.

### 3. **Makes API calls**
   - Fetch external data such as user preferences, account information, or customer records.
   - Example use case: Retrieve and preload personalized data to enhance the conversation's responsiveness and user experience.

## Implementation example

Below is a Python implementation of the **Start Function**:

```python
import datetime as dt
import re

def start_function(conv: Conversation):
    # Retrieve the current date and time
    now = dt.datetime.now()
    conv.state.current_date = now.strftime("%A %d-%m-%Y")
    conv.state.current_weekday = now.strftime("%A")
    conv.state.current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M")

    # Initialize state variables
    conv.state.available_times = None
    conv.state.user_bookings = None
    conv.state.phone_number = None

    # Extract the phone number from SIP headers
    from_header = conv.sip_headers.get('From', '')
    match = re.search(r"sip:(.+?)@", from_header)
    if match:
        conv.state.phone_number = match.group(1)

    # Return an empty string to indicate successful execution
    return str()
```

## Best practices for Start Function design

1. **Efficient execution**: Ensure the function completes quickly to minimize delays in starting the conversation.
2. **Error handling**:
   - Handle missing or malformed data gracefully to avoid runtime errors.
   - Provide fallbacks for incomplete or invalid information (like missing SIP headers).
3. **State initialization**:
   - Predefine and initialize all state variables needed for the conversation to avoid undefined behaviors.
4. **Contextual relevance**:
   - Only include setup steps that are directly relevant to the conversation's purpose.
   - Avoid overloading the Start Function with unnecessary logic.
