## Accuracy

- Jupiter and our Services utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in “Output” that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts.
When you use our Services you understand and agree:

- Output may not always be accurate. You should not rely on Output from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice.

- You must evaluate Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review as appropriate, before using or sharing Output from the Services.

- You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them.

- Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent PolyAI’s views. If Output references any Third Party Services or Third Party Outputs, it doesn’t mean the third party endorses, is endorsed by or affiliated with PolyAI.
