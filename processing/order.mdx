This page explains how a PolyAI agent processes a conversation, from caller input to response generation.

<Warning>The assistant's initial greeting is hardcoded and sent directly to TTS (Text-to-Speech) without running the LLM or processing any Rules. Write the greeting in the language you expect callers to hear. Any rules and logic begin after the greeting.</Warning>

## Processing stages

A conversation moves through the following stages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Input and processing">

  - **Caller**: The caller speaks into their device.
  - **Audio Stream**: The spoken input is captured and sent for transcription.
  - **ASR Provider**: The system receives the raw audio.
  - **[ASR Service](/speech-recognition/introduction)**: Converts the audio into text.
  - **ASR Processing**: Searches for transcription issues and applies any relevant corrections.
  - **Transcript Text â†’ Corrected Transcript**: The corrected transcript is passed to [Retrieval](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction).
  - **Retrieval**: Pulls relevant **topics retrieved** from the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) to provide context for the response.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Compute prompt and generate response">

  - **Compute Prompt**: The system builds an LLM prompt using retrieved topics, system knowledge, and conversation history.
  - **Run LLM**: The LLM processes the request and determines whether to return:
    - **Returned Text**: A direct text response.
    - **Returned Function**: A [function](/function/introduction) call.
  - **Execute Function (if applicable)**: Runs the function and passes the result back to the LLM.
  - **LLM Refinement**: If a function result is returned, the LLM updates its response before proceeding.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Streaming and chunking">

  - **Chunk LLM Output**: The response is broken into chunks before being sent to text-to-speech.
  - **Postprocess Chunks**: Applies rules such as [stop keywords](/response-control/introduction#use-stop-keywords-to-remove-unnecessary-preambles) to remove unnecessary phrases.
  - **Stream Partial Responses**: The system sends chunks as soon as they are ready, rather than waiting for the full response.
  - **TTS Service**: Converts text chunks into speech.
  - **TTS Provider**: Streams the synthesized speech back to the caller.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Post-processing and handoff">

  - **Live Handoff (if applicable)**: If escalation is needed, the agent triggers a [live handoff](/call-handoff/introduction).
  - **Conversation Logs**: The system stores conversation history and logs for [analytics](/analytics/conversations/introduction).
  - **Final Response**: The caller hears the completed response as it streams, without waiting for the entire message.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced: How response streaming works

PolyAI agents don't wait for the full response before speaking. Instead, responses are processed and streamed **in real time**:

- **LLM Streaming**: Words are generated and sent continuously.
- **Chunking**: Before reaching TTS, responses are broken into chunks for controlled delivery.
- **Postprocessing**: [Stop keywords](/response-control/introduction#use-stop-keywords-to-remove-unnecessary-preambles) remove unnecessary phrases before they are spoken.
- **TTS Streaming**: The caller hears speech as soon as it's processed, rather than waiting for the entire response.
