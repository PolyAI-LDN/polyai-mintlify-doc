Follow these steps to create an assistant on our platform:

## Step 1: Start the Creation Process
- After landing on the landing page, click the top right “Create Assistant” button to start your assistant creation process.

## Step 2: Set Project Name, Voice, and Greeting Line
- You will first see a page where you need to:
  - **Name your assistant** (this is different from the name that you want the assistant to know itself as)
  - **Choose a voice**
    - You may listen to the voice or configure it further. See the [Voice Configuration](/voice/introduction) section for more details.
    - [How to choose a good voice](/voice/what-is-good-voice)
  - **Set the welcome greeting**

- Once this is done, click "Next".

## Step 3: Choose Personality, Role, and Additional Info
- Next, you will see the page for choosing the personality, role, and additional info for your virtual assistant.

### What does personality mean?
- It defines the assistant's personality. See [here](/agent-settings/about) for more details.

### What does role mean and how are they different?
- The role defines the function or purpose of the assistant. Your assistant will act according to this role.
  - See [here](/agent-settings/about) for more details.

### What should we put for additional info?
- Provide additional info that you would like your assistant to be aware of regarding its operation.

## Step 4: Knowledge Base
- **What does that mean?**
  - Knowledge Base refers to the information and context the assistant will have access to. 
  - Knowledge base is best organized by topicsin order to keep it well-organized.
    - **What are good examples of knowledge base topics?**
      - Provide relevant information that the assistant can use to perform its tasks. For instance: hours of operation for the business, location information/address, pet policy, etc.
  - You can pick a few topics now to populate the Knowledge Base, and click on the "Create Assistant" button in the bottom right.

**For more information on how the Knowledge Base works, see the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base/introduction) section for more details.**

## Step 5: [Optional] Purchase a Number or Telephony Integration
- You should see an "Your assistant has been created!" modal, where you can do one of the following:
  - Buy phone number
    - Making this selection allows you to purchase either a US or UK phone number.
  - Connect an existing Twilio account to your Jupiter project/assistant
    - You can generate a SIP address and add this generated SIP address to your Twilio account.
  - Skip and decide later
- A brief introduction and a link to the [telephony integration section](/telephony/introduction).

Note that you can always test the assistant that you have created even if you do not integrate telephony.

By following these steps, you can create a personalized and effective assistant tailored to your needs.
