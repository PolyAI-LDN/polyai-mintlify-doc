Once you have created your agent in the project page, you can start a conversation with it through webchat, in-browser calling, or phone calls. This guide will help you understand how to interact with your agent.

## Webchat

Engage with your agent directly through the webchat interface. After creating your agent, you can start a conversation using webchat.

### How to start a webchat

1. **Navigate to the agent main page**:  
   Log in to your account and go to the agent main page.

### Webchat interface

- **Chat window**: The main area where you can type and receive messages.
- **Function calls**: Functions that the agent can execute based on your commands.
- **Topic citations**: Topics that the agent can recognize and respond to appropriately.
- Click the Settings icon to show or hide the function calls and topic citations settings.

## Phone calls

Connect with your agent by phone to test its voice and ASR. This method involves setting up a phone number, often through a service like [Twilio](/telephony/introduction).

### How to start a phone call

1. **Navigate to the agent main page**:  
   Log in to your account and go to the agent main page.  
   ![agent](/images/agent.png)

2. **Buy or connect a number**:  
   Click **"Add number"** to purchase a phone number or connect an existing Twilio account. For detailed instructions, visit the [Telephony Integration Section](/telephony/introduction).

A even faster and simpler way to test your agent's voice and automatic speech recognition (ASR) without setting up telephony services is to use in-browser calling using your device microphone.

### How to start an in-browser call

1. **Navigate to the agent main page**:
  Log in to your account and go to the agent main page.

2. **Click the phone icon**:
  In the top-right corner of the studio page, click the phone icon <Icon icon="phone" size={24} />.

3. **Select an agent version**:
  Use the dropdown menu to select the version of your agent to test.

4. **Begin testing**:
  Interact with your agent in real-time directly from your browser.

### Tips for phone calls

- **Clear communication**: Speak clearly to ensure the agent understands your commands.
- **Use keywords**: Use specific keywords and phrases to trigger the agent's functions.
- **Test variety**: Try male and female voices, different accents, and various scenarios to refine your agent's ASR performance.
- **Knowledge testing**: Test items added to your [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) or [global rules](/agent-settings/rules), including [TTS pronunciations](/agent-settings/rules#pronunciations).
