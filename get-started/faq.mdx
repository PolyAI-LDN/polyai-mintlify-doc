This section provides guidance on managing your assistant's Knowledge Base, Rules, and other configurations effectively. It
includes best practices and examples to ensure your assistant performs reliably and aligns with your project goals.

## Knowledge Base best practices

## Assistant personality and role

- **What is the best way to define the assistant's personality?**
  Avoid generic personality prompts like "You are a friendly and helpful assistant." Instead, embed specific tone and boundaries in Global Rules or KB topics.
  *Example Rule:*
  "Adopt a professional and concise tone. Only answer questions related to `<service>`."

- **Is defining a 'Role' for the assistant necessary?**
  It can help clarify what the assistant represents and how it interacts. Include this in the "About" section or Global Rules.
  *Example Role Description:*
  "You are a virtual assistant for [Brand], designed to handle customer service queries."

- **How should I structure KB topics?**
  A well-structured KB topic should include:
  - **Clear Topic Names:** Use concise and descriptive names like "Opening Hours" or "Refund Policy." This ensures accuracy in retrievals and improves analytics.
  - **Example User Queries:** Add 2–3 example user questions per topic. This helps the assistant determine whether a query matches a topic.
    *Example for "Refund Policy":*
    - "How do I get a refund?"
    - "Can I return a product for a refund?"
  - **Content and Actions:** Distinguish between what the assistant says (Content) and what it does (Actions). Content is ideal for information delivery, while Actions trigger workflows (e.g., SMS, handoff).
    *Example for "Payment Issues":*
    - Content: "Please confirm if you used a credit card or PayPal for this transaction."
    - Action: Trigger SMS to notify the billing team.

- **Should I focus on smaller or larger topics?**
  - Smaller, specific topics improve reporting and are easier to analyze.
  - Larger topics work better with models like GPT 4o-mini, which handle longer context windows.
  - Balance specificity and scope based on use cases.

- **What is the role of 'description' fields in KB topics?**
  The "description" or equivalent fields (e.g., "faq_description") should align with how the assistant retrieves or processes information. Some suggest renaming to "content" for clarity, as it acts as a bin of information the model draws from.

- **How can I design for disambiguation?**
  For queries requiring clarification, include disambiguation responses in the Content field.
  *Example:*
  Topic: "Booking Issues"
  Content: "Sure, I can help! Could you confirm if your booking was made online or over the phone?"

## Rules best practices

- **What are Global Rules, and how do I use them?**
  Global Rules set consistent behaviors across all interactions. Use them for guidelines like tone and scope. For example:
  - "Always remain professional and helpful."
  - "Only respond to queries related to the `<service>`."

- **Should I include examples in Global Rules?**
  Yes, examples improve clarity.
  *Example:*
  Rule: If the user asks for repetition, respond with "Let me repeat that for you."

- **How should I handle risky scenarios?**
  Identify high-risk interactions (e.g., refunds, emergencies) and set clear rules or KB topics to manage them.
  *Example for Refunds:*
  Rule: Route all refund-related queries to a support specialist.

## Specific scenarios

- **How do I handle out-of-scope questions?**
  Create a dedicated out-of-scope KB topic or include guidance in Global Rules.
  *Example Response:*
  "I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with that. Please contact our support team."

- **What are best practices for handoffs?**
  Use clear language and ensure appropriate configuration in KB topics or Global Rules.
  *Example:*
  "Handoff to emergency support for specialized assistance."

- **How can I manage SMS prompts effectively?**
  Use concise instructions in the Action field.
  *Example for SMS:*
  Action: Send SMS to user confirming payment received.

## Technical considerations

- **Does prompting affect ASR or TTS?**
  No, prompts do not directly influence Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Text-to-Speech (TTS). These components operate independently.

- **What are best practices for generating responses?**
  Instead of hard-coding responses, let the model generate them dynamically based on the context.
  *Example for Farewell Messages:*
  Avoid: "Goodbye, have a great day!" (hard-coded)
  Preferred: Dynamically generated: "Thanks for calling! Have a wonderful day!"

## Practical tips

- **What is the ideal structure for Knowledge Base entries?**
  Best practice suggests structuring KB entries into:
  - **User Queries:** 2–10 examples.
  - **Model Answer:** Concise and aligned with tone.
  - **Actions:** Functional steps like triggering a workflow or handoff.

- **How do I ensure consistency across multiple assistants?**
  Share templates for common scenarios (e.g., refunds, SMS configurations) to standardize behavior across projects.

- **How should I manage multilingual setups?**
  Write KB topics and system prompts in all required languages, and use embeddings models that support the target languages for effective retrieval.
