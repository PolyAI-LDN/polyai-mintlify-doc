Welcome to PolyAI's quickstart guide for voice and webchat agents. This should give you a brief overview of the main capabilities available to you
as a user of the Agent Studio platform, but there are many more features you can learn about by browsing the documentation or asking the AI assistant at the top of your window.

## Creating an agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the creation process">
    After logging in, click **"Create assistant"** to start the process.

![create-agent](/images/quickstart/create-assistant.png)

<Info>
  You can also **duplicate** an existing agent from the home page by clicking the three dots information icon next to a profile.
   ![duplicate-agent](/images/quickstart/duplicate-agent.png)
   The duplicated profile will have the same name as the original, but appended with `(copy)`. You can also export and import existing agents from `.bin` files.
</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a name, response language, voice, and greeting line">

    Full page: [**Voice**](/voice/introduction), [**Agent settings**](/agent-settings/introduction)

Create a new agent by entering an **agent name**, **response language**, **voice**, and **the welcome greeting**.

You can also set a project ID here, which will determine your URL.

After completing these steps, click **"Next"**.

  </Step>

<Step title="Entering Agent Studio and the knowledge base">

Once you have created your agent, you will see is a blank knowledge base. Other functionality and settings are available on the left-side navigation bar.

![general](/images/quickstart/home.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Add a knowledge base item">

Let's get started by giving your agent some information it can use.

Full page: [**Knowledge base**](/knowledge-base/introduction)

To teach your agent factual information, you can add **knowledge base items**.
Each item contains:
- A topic title (for example, "The café's opening hours")
- A set of sample questions that users might ask (e.g., "When do you close?")
- The answer content your agent should return (e.g., "The café is closed on Mondays…").

You can also add [Actions](/knowledge-base/how-to-setup-action/introduction) to connect knowledge items with functions, APIs, or follow-up flows.

<Tip>
  When editing or adding knowledge, changes are saved as **Drafts**. You can then publish to the **Sandbox** for internal testing before moving to **Pre-release** or **Live** environments. For more information on the deployment pipeline, visit the [environments and versions](/environments-and-versions/introduction) feature page.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Change your language model">

    Go to **Settings → Model** to select which LLM will power your agent. The default is **GPT-4o Mini**, but others like **Claude 3.5 Haiku** or PolyAI's **Raven** are also available depending on use case.

Full page: [**Model Selection**](/agent-settings/model-use)

  </Step>

  <Step title="[Voice agents only] Select a number for telephony integration">
    Full page: [**Telephony Integration**](/telephony/introduction)

You may buy a number or connect an existing number for your agent. You can also skip this step and return later.

![telephony](/images/quickstart/telephony.png)

</Step>

<Step title="[Webchat agents only] Design your chat widget">
  Full page: [**Webchat**](/webchat/introduction)

Use the **Webchat Customize tab** to set how the widget will look on your site.
You can update the:

- **Header text** – the title shown in the chat window (e.g. “Cafe Assistant Cassandra”).
- **Primary color** – controls the header background and action elements like buttons. Enter a hex code or use the color picker.

The right-hand panel shows a **live preview** of your widget, updating instantly as you change settings. This lets you verify styling, branding, and greeting text before publishing.

![webchat customization example](/images/quickstart/webchat.png)

<Info>
After changing styles, you must redeploy the widget under **Test and install → Generate script tag** so updates appear on your site.
</Info>

</Step>

  <Step title="[Advanced] Integrate functions into your knowledge base">

    Full page: [**Functions**](/function/introduction)

**What they do**: Functions allow you to add dynamic, programmable behavior to your agent, and allow you to handle external API calls, retrieve specific data, and use that data to make decisions based on real-time context.

Example use case: An agent retrieving shipping information for a customer query about an order.

![functions](/images/quickstart/functions.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="[Advanced] Add a flow to your project">

    Full page: [**Flows**](/flows/introduction)

**What they do**: Flows are designed for managing multi-step conversations, like booking a table at a restaurant, resetting a password, or collecting feedback.

Example use case: A customer reservation flow for a restaurant, with steps to ask for the date, time, and number of people before confirming the booking, as well as handling any problems that might arise along the way.

![flows](/images/quickstart/flows.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your agent (web-chat, browser call, or phone)">

    Full page: [**Agent Chat**](/get-started/agent-chat)

    You can test your agent without deploying by:
    - Using the **web chat interface**
     - Making an **in-browser voice call** using the phone icon
    - Calling from a connected number

  </Step>

    <Step title="Publish your agent">

       Full page: [Environments & versions](/environments-and-versions/introduction)

       Once you have completed setup:
       * Publish your agent to the **Sandbox** for internal testing.
       * Promote to **Pre-release** for user testing and QA.
       * Finally, promote it to **Live** to once it production-ready.

       Each environment can be linked to a separate phone number and has rollback capabilities.

    </Step>

</Steps>

By following these steps, you can create a personalized and effective agent tailored to your needs.

## How does my agent work?

Full page: [Processing order](/essentials/order)

Once your agent is setup, here is how it will process calls:

	1.	Caller speaks: The agent receives the caller's input as an audio stream.
	2.	ASR Service: Transcribes the audio into text.
	3.	LLM Service: Interprets the request and determines an appropriate response.
	4.	TTS Service: Converts the response back into speech and delivers it to the caller.

This cycle allows for real-time, responsive interactions. For a deeper breakdown of processing steps, see the advanced conversation flow processing order page.

<Tip>To tune your agent's latency and style of reply, try adjusting the **Interaction Style** slider under [**Audio Management**](/audio-management/introduction). Choose between **Turbo**, **Swift**, **Balanced**, or **Precise**.</Tip>

<Tip>
  You can set a custom disclaimer message to precede the call using an alternate voice.
     ![multi-voice](/images/quickstart/multivoice.png)
  You can also assign **multiple voices** to your agent using the **Multi-voice UI** under Voice settings. Voices can be distributed across calls by percentage.
</Tip>
