If you already have an agent set up and working, and are just looking for information on maintaining it, visit the maintenance guide.

## Creating an agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the creation process">
    After logging in, click **"Create assistant"** to start the process.

<Info>
  You can also **duplicate** an existing agent from the home page by clicking the three dots information icon next to a profile.
   ![duplicate-agent](/images/quickstart/duplicate-agent.png)
   The duplicated profile will have the same name as the original, but appended with `(copy)`. You can also export and import existing agents as `.bin` files.
</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a name, response language, voice, and greeting line">

    Full page: [**Voice**](/voice/introduction), [**Agent settings**](/agent-settings/introduction)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select personality, role, and additional info">

    Next, select the **personality**, **role**, and enter the **additional info** for your agent.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select knowledge topics">

    Full page: [**Knowledge base**](/knowledge-base/introduction)

Knowledge refers to the information and context the agent will have access to.

![knowledge](/images/knowledge.png)

You can configure **Actions**, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), and inline messaging with the **Knowledge Base UI**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="[Optional] Select a number for telephony integration">
    Full page: [**Telephony Integration**](/telephony/introduction)

You may buy a number or connect an existing number for your agent. You can also skip this step and return later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="[Advanced] Integrate functions into your knowledge base">

    Full page: [**Functions**](/function/introduction)

**What they do**: Functions allow you to add dynamic, programmable behavior to your agent, and allow you to handle external API calls, retrieve specific data, and use that data to make decisions based on real-time context.

Example use case: An agent retrieving shipping information for a customer query about an order.

  </Step>

  <Step title="[Advanced] Add a flow to your project">

    Full page: [**Flows**](/flows/introduction)
**What they do**: Flows are designed for managing multi-step conversations, like booking a table at a restaurant, resetting a password, or collecting feedback.

Example use case: A customer reservation flow for a restaurant, with steps to ask for the date, time, and number of people before confirming the booking, as well as handling any problems that might arise along the way.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your agent (web-chat, browser call, or phone)">

    Full page: [**Agent Chat**](/get-started/agent-chat)

    You can test your agent without deploying by:
    - Using the **web chat interface**
     - Making an **in-browser voice call** using the phone icon
    - Calling from a connected number

  </Step>

    <Step title="Publish your agent">

       Full page: [Environments & versions](/environments-and-versions/introduction)

       Once you have completed setup:
       * Publish your agent to the **Sandbox** for internal testing.
       * Promote to **Pre-release** for user testing and QA.
       * Finally, promote it to **Live** to once it production-ready.

       Each environment can be linked to a separate phone number and has rollback capabilities.

    </Step>

</Steps>

By following these steps, you can create a personalized and effective agent tailored to your needs.

## How does my agent work?

Full page: [Processing order](/essentials/order)

Once your agent is setup, here is how it will process calls:

	1.	Caller speaks: The agent receives the caller's input as an audio stream.
	2.	ASR Service: Transcribes the audio into text.
	3.	LLM Service: Interprets the request and determines an appropriate response.
	4.	TTS Service: Converts the response back into speech and delivers it to the caller.

This cycle allows for real-time, responsive interactions. For a deeper breakdown of processing steps, see the advanced conversation flow processing order page.

<Tip>To tune your agent's latency and style of reply, try adjusting the **Interaction Style** slider under [**Audio Management**](/audio-management/introduction). Choose between **Turbo**, **Swift**, **Balanced**, or **Precise**.</Tip>

<Tip>
  You can set a custom disclaimer message to precede the call using an alternate voice.
     ![multi-voice](/images/quickstart/multivoice.png)
  You can also assign **multiple voices** to your agent using the **Multi-voice UI** under Voice settings. Voices can be distributed across calls by percentage.
</Tip>
