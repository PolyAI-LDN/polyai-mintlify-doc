Once you have created your assistant in the project page, you can start a conversation with it through webchat, in-browser calling, or phone calls. This guide will help you understand how to interact with your assistant.

## Webchat

### How to start a webchat

## In-browser calling

A even faster and simpler way to test your assistant's voice and automatic speech recognition (ASR) without setting up telephony services is to use in-browser calling using your device microphone.

### How to start an in-browser call

1. **Navigate to the assistant main page**:
  Log in to your account and go to the assistant main page.

2. **Click the phone icon**:
  In the top-right corner of the platform page, click the phone icon <Icon icon="phone" size={24} />.

3. **Select an assistant version**:
  Use the dropdown menu to select the version of your assistant to test.

4. **Begin testing**:
  Interact with your assistant in real-time directly from your browser.

### Tips for phone calls

- **Clear communication**: Speak clearly to ensure the assistant understands your commands.
- **Use keywords**: Use specific keywords and phrases to trigger the assistant's functions.
- **Test variety**: Try male and female voices, different accents, and various scenarios to refine your assistant's ASR performance.
- **Knowledge testing**: Test items added to your [knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction) or [global rules](/agent-settings/rules), including [TTS pronunciations](/agent-settings/rules#pronunciations).
