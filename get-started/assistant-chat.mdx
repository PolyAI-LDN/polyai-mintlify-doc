This should showcase; After creator created the assistant (in the project page), how can they start a conversation with the assitant

1. webchat - explain which button to click and what the UI/ UX is like (e.g. function call annotation/ topic annotation)

2. phone call - should include instruction about linking up twilio or buy a number - should link to the telephony section for more details - keep it short and light and expect people to get the number from telephony page.
