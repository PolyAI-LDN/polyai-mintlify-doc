Welcome to Jupiter! We offer two convenient methods for creating an account on our platform. You can choose the method that best suits your preference:

## 1. Google Single Sign-On (SSO)

Using Google SSO allows you to quickly and securely create an account by linking your existing Google account. This method simplifies the sign-up process and eliminates the need to remember another password.

### Benefits of Google SSO:
- **Speed**: Sign up in just a few clicks.
- **Security**: Leverages Google's robust security infrastructure.
- **Convenience**: No need to create and remember a new password.

For detailed instructions on how to create an account using Google SSO, please visit the [Google SSO Account Creation](./google-sso) page.

## 2. Email and Password

If you prefer not to use a Google account, you can create an account using your email address and a password. This method provides flexibility and allows you to use any email address you prefer.

### Benefits of Email and Password:
- **Flexibility**: Use any email address for registration.
- **Control**: Manage your password and account details independently.

For detailed instructions on how to create an account using your email and a password, please visit the [Email and Password Account Creation](./email-pwd) page.

Choose the method that works best for you and start your journey with Jupiter today!
