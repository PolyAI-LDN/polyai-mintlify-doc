We should provide instruction to support 2 account creation path

1. Google SSO - We need to show screenshot or video on how the experience would be like for first time users through Google SSO

2. Email/ password - We need to show screenshot or video of how to click through the full process. Note: password requirement etc should be mentioned


If you see needs to link to FAQ/ common seen error, just provide a random link in the doc and we would link it up later*
