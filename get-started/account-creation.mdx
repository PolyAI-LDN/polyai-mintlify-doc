### Benefits of Google SSO

### Benefits of email and password
- **Flexibility**: Use any email address for registration.
- **Control**: Manage your password and account details independently.

### 1. Navigate to the sign-up page
   - Go to the **sign-up page**: [https://login.jupiter.poly.ai/](https://login.jupiter.poly.ai/).
