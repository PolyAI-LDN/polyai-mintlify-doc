The **Configuration Builder** allows builders to define JSON schemas that generate structured config forms. These forms let managers safely
update settings—like opening hours or toggle flags—across environments.

## How it works

Configuration Builder separates **structure** (schema) from **values** (data).

| Tab     | Purpose                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Schema** | Define what fields exist (like opening hours, toggles) |
| **Data**   | Fill in the environment-specific values |

The schema ensures consistent structure and validation. The data defines what the agent uses at runtime.

<Warning>
The configuration builder is not tied to the main publish lifecycle.

The builder sits **outside the agent's draft/publish system**, so changes to schema and values take effect immediately.

This means:
- An empty config file that receives a schema will instantly expose real-time fields to fill.
- Any changes to schema or data will reflect immediately across all environments.
</Warning>

## Step-by-step

### 1. Create a schema

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/config-schema.png" alt="Live config UI showing example values" />
</Frame>

In **Configuration Builder → Schema**, define the fields your manager should configure. For example:

- A text field for `opening_hours`
- A toggle for `after_hours_enabled`
- A validated phone number for `fallback_number`

These fields are written in JSON Schema format. The schema drives the form layout in the next step.

<Info>Use clear "title" and "description" values—these labels will be visible in the real-time UI.</Info>

```json
{
  "title": "Assistant Settings",
  "description": "Set call handling parameters for this assistant",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "opening_hours": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Opening Hours",
      "description": "Hours during which the assistant should be available"
    },
    "after_hours_enabled": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "title": "After Hours Message",
      "description": "Enable this toggle to play a message outside business hours"
    },
    "fallback_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Fallback Contact Number",
      "description": "Phone number to call if no agent is available",
      "pattern": "^\\+44\\d{10}$"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. (Optional) Add environment-specific values

</Frame>

Once a schema is saved, the Real Time Configuration UI will appear automatically, even if no values are set.

You *can*, however, populate values manually, at any time, in the **Data** tab, where each environment (Draft, Pre-release, Live) maintains its own data.

```json
{
  "opening_hours": "Mon–Fri, 9am to 6pm",
  "after_hours_enabled": true,
  "fallback_number": "+442071234567"
}
```

Fields can be left blank unless marked required.

### 3. Publish

You **do not need to publish** your assistant for config changes to take effect.
However, publishing may still be useful if you want to include these changes in a documented release.

Once your schema is added, the **Real Time Configuration** tab becomes available for managers to enter values for:

- **Draft and Sandbox**
- **Pre-release**
- **Live**

</Frame>

### 4. Add the read config in your functions

Use the [conv.real_time_config](/function/classes/conv-object/#real-time-config) helper to read real-time values.

```python
config = conv.real_time_config
hours = config.get("opening_hours")
after_hours = config.get("after_hours_enabled")
fallback = config.get("fallback_number")

if after_hours:
    conv.say("We're currently closed. Please call back during business hours.")
    conv.transfer_call(fallback)
```

<Tip>All values are returned as a dictionary. Use .get("key") to safely access fields.</Tip>

## Best practices

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Design schemas for clarity. Labels and descriptions help non-technical users.

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Validate critical fields (like phone numbers) with regex.

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Test behavior across all environments before deploying to Live.

<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" color="#2D8C66" /> Keep track of which flows and functions use which configuration fields.

## What happens if the schema changes?

If the schema is edited in a way that invalidates existing data, the system will prevent publishing until all environments are valid again.

## Can each environment have different values?

Yes. For example, you can test one phone number in **pre-release** while using a different one in **live**.
