Welcome to the PolyAI Glossary. This page defines key terms, acronyms, and concepts used across our platform, ensuring clarity and consistency.

## Aâ€“C

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An interface that allows software components to communicate with each other. PolyAI provides APIs for integrating AI agents with external systems.

### ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
Technology that converts spoken language into text. ASR is critical for processing voice interactions.

### Audio Caching
A mechanism that stores pre-rendered audio responses to reduce latency and improve user experience.

## Dâ€“F

### Dashboards
Customizable analytics views that provide insights into agent performance, conversation trends, and user interactions.

### End Function
A function triggered at the conclusion of an interaction to finalize data handoff or logging.

### Function Latency Control
A feature that manages delayed function responses by triggering interim utterances or filler audio.

## Gâ€“L

### Global Rules
Predefined behavior constraints applied across all agent interactions to ensure consistency in responses, compliance, and tone.

### Intent Recognition
The AIâ€™s ability to determine a userâ€™s goal or request based on their input.

### Knowledge Base (KB)
A structured repository of predefined responses and content used to power AI-generated answers.

## Mâ€“P

### Mintlify
The documentation platform used to publish PolyAIâ€™s product and API docs.

### Multi-Site Configuration
The ability to customize agent responses based on location, using variant management.

### Prompt Engineering
The process of designing inputs that optimize AI-generated responses.

## Qâ€“Z

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A method where the AI retrieves external information to enhance its response accuracy.

### SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)
A markup language used to fine-tune text-to-speech (TTS) output, adjusting tone, pronunciation, and pacing.

### Variants
Configuration settings that adjust an agentâ€™s responses based on context, such as region, brand, or customer type.
