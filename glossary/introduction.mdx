Welcome to the PolyAI glossary.

This page explains some of the key terms, acronyms, and concepts used across our platform.

## A–C

### Agent
A PolyAI AI-driven voice assistant that interacts with customers in real-time via speech or text. Agents handle customer conversations autonomously while integrating with external data sources.

### Agent Studio
The primary interface for designing, configuring, and deploying AI agents. Agent Studio serves both builders (creating AI logic) and managers (monitoring performance and analytics).

### Annotation
Full article: [Conversation review](/analytics/conversations/review).
A manual tag applied during Conversation Review to highlight issues like incorrect transcriptions or missing knowledge base topics.

### Chunking

### Containment rate
The percentage of calls fully handled by the agent without requiring a human handoff.

### Conversation metadata
Structured data about a conversation, including duration, start time, and associated agent variant.

### Conversation diagnosis
A tool within Conversation Review that shows which flows, function calls, and knowledge base topics were activated during a call.

## D–F

### End function
Full article: [End function](/function/end-function)

A function that finalizes an interaction, used when an AI agent has completed its task. It can:
- Close conversations and send confirmation messages.
- Trigger logging or analytics tracking.
- Perform clean-up actions before ending the session.

### Flows
Full article: [Flows](/flows/introduction)

Also known as Talk Tracks, flows use conversation logic system that determines how an AI agent guides a user through an interaction. Flows define:
- Decision points (when the AI needs user input)
- Branching logic (how responses change based on user choices)
- Automated actions (like triggering a function call)

### Function
Full article: [Function](/function/introduction)

A reusable backend operation that an AI agent can execute during a conversation. Functions allow agents to:
- Retrieve external data (like fetching an order status).
- Modify system state (like updating a customer's profile).
- Perform calculations or conditional logic.

A **function call** is when an agent invokes a function to retrieve information, or perform an action in real time.

## G–L

### Global rules
Full article: [Rules](/agent-settings/rules)

Predefined behavior constraints applied across all agent interactions to ensure:
- Consistency in responses
- Compliance with business policies
- Controlled conversational tone

### Handoff
Full article: [Call handoff](/call-handoff/introduction)

The process of transferring a user from an AI agent to a human agent. Handoffs can be:
- Rule-based (triggered by predefined conditions)
- User-requested (when a customer asks for a human)
- AI-driven (when the agent determines it cannot complete the task)

### Knowledge base
Full article: [Knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction)

A structured repository of predefined responses and business-specific information that AI agents use to generate accurate answers.

### Environment
Refers to the deployment stage of a project, such as `sandbox`, `pre-release`, or `live`. Used in API queries and analytics.

## M–P

### Multi-site configuration
The ability to customize agent responses based on location, using [variant management](#variant).

### PolyLLM
PolyAI's proprietary model, optimized for real-time voice interactions. Offers low-latency responses with high alignment to voice assistant use cases.

### Processing

### Pronunciations
Custom rules used to adjust how the agent pronounces specific terms via IPA and regex-based substitution.

### Performance metrics
See: [Containment Rate](#containment-rate), [Conversation Metadata](#conversation-metadata), [Safety Dashboard](#safety-dashboard)

## Q–Z

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Full article: [RAG](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction)

A method where the AI first retrieves relevant knowledge from the KB before generating a response, ensuring more accurate, context-aware replies.

### Response control
Full article: [Response control](/response-control/introduction)

A system that modifies how AI agents respond in different scenarios. Includes:
- Rate-limiting (preventing excessive responses)
- Interruption handling (allowing users to cut off the AI mid-sentence)
- Compliance filtering (ensuring safe and appropriate responses)

### Safety dashboard
A specialized dashboard to monitor flagged content, risky user utterances, and the performance of safety filters.

### Secrets
Sensitive credentials or tokens that can be securely stored and accessed by the agent for integrations.

### Start function
Full article: [Start function](/function/start-function)

A function triggered at the beginning of an interaction, often used to:
- Initialize conversation state (e.g., retrieve user history).
- Perform authentication or setup tasks.
- Trigger conditional logic based on user input.

### Streaming

### Talk Tracks
See [flows](#flows).

### Transcript correction
Full article: [Speech recognition](/speech-recognition/introduction#transcript-corrections)

A feature that enables users to edit AI-generated conversation transcripts, improving:
- Speech recognition accuracy
- Compliance with business policies
- Training data quality

### Validation
Full article: [Flows](/flows/introduction)

A moment in the conversation where the assistant checks whether the information provided by the user is complete, accurate, or matches expected criteria.

Validation may include:
- Repeating back a value to confirm correctness (e.g. "That's 07888 888888 — is that right?")
- Comparing user input against a list (e.g. matching a name to a reservation)
- Prompting again if the input is unclear, incomplete, or invalid

Validation ensures the assistant gathers usable information before continuing with a task or triggering a function.

### Variable
Full article: [Variables](/function/variables)

Variables are used to store and retrieve values during a conversation. In PolyAI, they are accessed through the [`conv.state`](/function/classes/conv-object#state) object, which behaves like a dictionary. Variables allow agents to track context, user inputs, flags, counters, and other custom values needed for decision-making across turns.

**Example:**
```python
conv.state.user_name = "Aaron"
if conv.state.has_account:
    conv.goto_flow("account_support")
```

All variables persist for the duration of a single conversation and are cleared at the end unless explicitly saved elsewhere.

### Variant
Full article: [Variant management](/variant-management/introduction)

A tool for testing multiple conversational styles within an AI agent, allowing:
- A/B testing across different dialogue configurations
- Controlled rollouts of conversation updates
- Customization per brand, region, or customer type

### Variant ID
Fields used in API filters and analytics to identify and segment conversations by specific agent variant versions.
