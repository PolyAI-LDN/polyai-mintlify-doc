Welcome to the PolyAI glossary.

This page explains some of the key terms, acronyms, and concepts used across our platform.

## A–C

### Agent
A PolyAI AI-driven voice assistant that interacts with customers in real-time via speech or text. Agents handle customer conversations autonomously while integrating with external data sources.

### Agent Studio
The primary interface for designing, configuring, and deploying AI agents. Agent Studio serves both builders (creating AI logic) and managers (monitoring performance and analytics).

### Conversational Review

Full article: [Conversation review](/analytics/conversation/review)

A post-interaction analysis tool that allows teams to:
- Review AI-generated transcripts for quality control.
- Manually annotate issues in AI responses.
- Improve AI accuracy by feeding corrections back into the system.

## D–F

### End Function

Full article: [End function](/function/end-function)

A function that finalizes an interaction, used when an AI agent has completed its task. It can:
- Close conversations and send confirmation messages.
- Trigger logging or analytics tracking.
- Perform clean-up actions before ending the session.

### Flows

Full article: [Flows](/flows/introduction)

Also known as Talk Tracks, flows use conversation logic system that determines how an AI agent guides a user through an interaction. Flows define:
- Decision points (when the AI needs user input)
- Branching logic (how responses change based on user choices)
- Automated actions (like triggering a function call)

### Function

Full article: [Function](/function/introduction)

A reusable backend operation that an AI agent can execute during a conversation. Functions allow agents to:
- Retrieve external data (like fetching an order status).
- Modify system state (like updating a customer's profile).
- Perform calculations or conditional logic.

A **function call** is when an agent invokes a function to retrieve information, or perform an action in real time.

## G–L

### Global Rules

Full article: [Rules](/agent-settings/rules)

Predefined behavior constraints applied across all assistant interactions to ensure:
- Consistency in responses
- Compliance with business policies
- Controlled conversational tone

### Handoff

Full article: [Call handoff](/call-handoff/introduction)

The process of transferring a user from an AI agent to a human agent. Handoffs can be:
- Rule-based (triggered by predefined conditions)
- User-requested (when a customer asks for a human)
- AI-driven (when the agent determines it cannot complete the task)

### Knowledge Base

Full article: [Knowledge base](/knowledge-base/introduction)

A structured repository of predefined responses and business-specific information that AI agents use to generate accurate answers.

## M–P

### Multi-Site Configuration
The ability to customize assistant responses based on location, using variant management.

### Prompt Engineering
The process of designing inputs that optimize AI-generated responses.

## Q–Z

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Full article: [RAG](/knowledge-base/RAG/introduction)

A method where the AI first retrieves relevant knowledge from the KB before generating a response, ensuring more accurate, context-aware replies.

### Response Control

Full article: [Response control](/response-control/introduction)

A system that modifies how AI agents respond in different scenarios. Includes:
- Rate-limiting (preventing excessive responses)
- Interruption handling (allowing users to cut off the AI mid-sentence)
- Compliance filtering (ensuring safe and appropriate responses)

### Start Function

Full article: [Start function](/function/start-function)

A function triggered at the beginning of an interaction, often used to:
- Initialize conversation state (e.g., retrieve user history).
- Perform authentication or setup tasks.
- Trigger conditional logic based on user input.

### Talk Tracks

See [flows](#flows).

### Transcript Correction

Full article: [Speech recognition](/speech-recognition/introduction#transcript-corrections)

A feature that enables users to edit AI-generated conversation transcripts, improving:
- Speech recognition accuracy
- Compliance with business policies
- Training data quality

### Variant

Full article: [Variant management](/variant-management/introduction)

A tool for testing multiple conversational styles within an AI agent, allowing:
- A/B testing across different dialogue configurations
- Controlled rollouts of conversation updates
- Customization per brand, region, or customer type
