PolyAI's OpenTable integration enables AI voice assistant capability for both [Core](https://www.opentable.com/restaurant-solutions/plans/core/)
and [Pro](https://www.opentable.com/restaurant-solutions/plans/pro/) OpenTable customers. The integration is handled by providing a
 unique identifier provided by PolyAI to the OpenTable marketplace.

<Info>Before getting started, you should have both an OpenTable and PolyAI account.</Info>
