## Introduction

PolyAI integrates with the Epic electronic health record (EHR) system to enable conversational experiences that are context-aware, accurate, and compliant with healthcare workflows. By connecting PolyAI to Epic, healthcare organisations can allow virtual agents to access relevant patient and operational information (subject to permissions), improving self-service capabilities, reducing administrative burden, and enhancing patient experience while maintaining strict security and governance standards.

This integration uses Epic’s SMART on FHIR framework and requires approval through Epic’s trusted application process before PolyAI can access the necessary resources.

## How to Integrate Epic with PolyAI

To complete the integration, you will submit an Epic integration request using the PolyAI Epic App details, then confirm the request in PolyAI Agent Studio so the PolyAI team can review and approve it.

### Step 1: Log in to Your Epic Account

1. Log in to your **Epic** administrative account.
2. Navigate to the section for managing **Build App**
3. Under **My Apps**, pick the app you would like to integrate with PolyAI. Follow the instruction to submit the integration request over to PolyAI.

### Step 2: Submit an Integration Request to the PolyAI Epic App

Invite the **PolyAI Epic App** as a trusted application using the details below.

#### Application Details

- **Application Name:** PolyAI
- **Client ID:**\
  `c6cc31b3-800f-4297-8d5c-08f56ed57fa3`
- **Non-Production Client ID:**\
  `a0d62d80-de30-4261-a963-34790dbf0473`
- **SMART Scope:** SMART V1
- **FHIR Version:** R4

Ensure that the appropriate scopes and permissions are configured according to your organisation’s requirements and Epic policies.

Once all required fields are completed, submit the integration request in Epic.

### Step 3: Submit the Request in PolyAI Agent Studio

After submitting the request in Epic:

1. Log in to **PolyAI Agent Studio**
2. Open your **Project**
3. Navigate to **Integrations**
4. Locate the **Epic** integration tile
5. Click **Submit Request**

This links your Epic submission with your PolyAI project.

### Step 4: PolyAI Review and Approval

Once both steps are complete:

- Your request will remain in a **pending** state
- The **PolyAI team** will review the Epic integration request
- PolyAI will reach out if additional information or configuration is required

After approval, the Epic integration will be completed and ready for use within your PolyAI project.
