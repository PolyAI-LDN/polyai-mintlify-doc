Salesforce is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage customer interactions, track sales, and automate workflows. 
It offers a suite of tools for marketing, sales, commerce, and customer service.

## Why use Salesforce with PolyAI?

Integrating Salesforce with PolyAI allows businesses to streamline workflows and enhance customer service capabilities over the voice channel. Examples include:

- **Automated case creation**: PolyAI's voice agent can collect details during customer calls and create cases in Salesforce automatically, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy.
- **Real-time customer insights**: PolyAI retrieves customer details from Salesforce during calls, so calls are personalized and informed.
- **Effortless follow-up**: After a call, PolyAI can send customers follow-up text messages like reservation notifications or order confirmations.

## Getting started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. A **Salesforce Account**: Administrator access to a Salesforce account.
2. **PolyAI Access**: Access credentials for the PolyAI Portal.

## Set up Salesforce for API access

Follow these steps to enable API access in Salesforce:

1. **Enable API Access**:
    - Log in to Salesforce with admin privileges.
    - Go to **Setup > Users > Profiles**.
    - Edit the profile for the user account that will connect to PolyAI.
    - Ensure the checkbox for **API Enabled** is selected.
2. **Create a Connected App**:
    - Go to **Setup > App Manager**.
    - Click **New Connected App**.
    - Fill in the following details:
        - **Connected App Name**: `PolyAI Integration`.
        - **API Name**: `PolyAIIntegration`.
        - **Contact Email**: Enter your email.
        - **Enable OAuth Settings**: Check this box.
        - **Callback URL**: Enter `https://www.example.com/oauth/callback` (replace with your actual callback URL).
        - **Selected OAuth Scopes**: Add `Full Access (full)` and `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`.
    - Save the connected app and note the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.
3. **Provide PolyAI with the Required Information**:
    - **Client ID**: The Consumer Key of your Connected App.
    - **Client Secret**: The Consumer Secret of your Connected App.
    - **Username**: The Salesforce username for the integration.
    - **Password**: The Salesforce password for the user, appended with the security token.
    - **Access Token URL**: Typically `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` (for production) or `https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` (for sandbox).
    - **Base URL**: The root URL of your Salesforce instance (e.g., `https://your_instance.salesforce.com`).

PolyAI will use these details to generate the necessary `access_token`. Credentials will be passed in the Authorization header as specified in the OAuth spec.

## Code example

The following is a simplified Python example that demonstrates how to create a case in Salesforce using their REST API.

```python
import requests

def create_salesforce_case(base_url, access_token, case_data):
    """
    Create a case in Salesforce.

    :param base_url: Salesforce base URL (e.g., https://your_instance.salesforce.com)
    :param access_token: OAuth access token
    :param case_data: Dictionary containing case details
    """
    url = f"{base_url}/services/data/v55.0/sobjects/Case"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=case_data)

    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("Case created successfully!", response.json())
    else:
        print("Failed to create case.", response.status_code, response.text)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_url = "https://your_instance.salesforce.com"
    access_token = "your_access_token"

    case_data = {
        "Subject": "Support Request",
        "Description": "Details about the issue.",
        "Origin": "Web",
        "Status": "New"
    }

    create_salesforce_case(base_url, access_token, case_data)
```

## Next steps

**Keep in touch!** Once you provide PolyAI with the necessary information (outlined above), they will reach out once your integration is configured. They will ensure the following is in good working order:

1. **Error Handling**: Handle HTTP status codes like `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, and `400 Bad Request`.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure users provide all required fields (e.g., names, valid phone numbers).
3. **Token Renewal**: Monitor token expiration and re-run the OAuth flow to obtain fresh tokens.

Depending on your use case, PolyAI may need to support custom functionality. Let us know, and we will confirm if we can accommodate.
