The Zoom integration enables your AI agent to manage Zoom meetings, registrants, and recordings on behalf of users. This integration uses OAuth 2.0 to securely connect
to your Zoom account without storing any credentials in PolyAI systems.

## Connecting Zoom

### Prerequisites

- A Zoom account (Basic, Pro, Business, or Enterprise)
- Project management permissions in PolyAI

### Connection Steps

1. **Go to Integrations**
   - Open your project in the PolyAI platform
   - Go to the **Integrations** page from the main navigation

2. **Find Zoom integration**
   - Locate the Zoom card in the integrations list
   - You can use the search bar or filter by category (Telephony)

3. **Click Connect**
   - Click the **Connect** button on the Zoom integration card
   - The integration panel will open on the right side

4. **Select Environment**
   - Choose which environment to connect: **Sandbox**, **Pre-release**, or **Live**
   - We recommend starting with Sandbox for testing

5. **Authenticate with Zoom**
   - Click **Connect new account**
   - A Zoom OAuth window will open
   - Log in to your Zoom account
   - Review and approve the requested permissions
   - You'll be redirected back to PolyAI automatically

6. **Confirmation**
   - Your Zoom account name will appear in the connection panel
   - The integration is now active for the selected environment

### Managing connections

- **Multiple Environments**: You can use the same Zoom account across different environments, or connect different accounts for each
- **Switching Accounts**: Use the "Use existing connection" dropdown to reuse a connection in another environment
- **Disconnecting**: Click the disconnect button to revoke access (this removes credentials from PolyAI)

## Available Zoom actions

Once connected, your AI agent can access the following Zoom capabilities:

### Meeting Management

- **Create Meeting** - Schedule a new Zoom meeting with topic, start time, duration, and participant settings
- **Update Meeting** - Update details of an existing scheduled Zoom meeting
- **Get Meetings** - Get details of all scheduled Zoom meetings
- **Get Meeting** - Get details of a specific Zoom meeting
- **Delete Meeting** - Cancel a scheduled Zoom meeting

### Meeting Registrants

- **Add Meeting Registrant** - Register a participant for a Zoom meeting that requires registration
- **Get Meeting Registrant** - Get registration details for a meeting participant
- **Delete Meeting Registrant** - Remove a registrant from a Zoom meeting

### Recordings

- **Get Recording** - Retrieve cloud recording from a specific Zoom meeting
- **Search Recordings** - Search for Zoom meeting recordings

## Enabling Zoom actions

To give your agent access to Zoom functionality, you need to reference Zoom actions in your agent's prompts. You can choose to enable all actions at once or select specific actions.

### Enabling all actions

To give your agent access to all Zoom capabilities, add **All Zoom Actions** to your prompt in the integrations section.

**Example:**
```
You are a helpful assistant that can manage Zoom meetings.
When a user asks you to schedule a meeting, use the available Zoom functions.
```

Your agent will then have access to all 10 Zoom actions listed above.

### Enabling specific actions

You can limit your agent to only certain Zoom actions by selecting individual functions in your prompt:

**Example (meeting creation only):**
```
You are a meeting scheduler assistant.
You can schedule Zoom meetings for users, but cannot modify or delete existing meetings.
```

Select only **Create Meeting** from the available actions.

**Example (meeting management):**
```
You are a meeting management assistant that can create, update, and cancel Zoom meetings.
```

Select **Create Meeting**, **Update Meeting**, and **Delete Meeting** from the available actions.

### Best practices

**Use All Zoom Actions when:**
- You want full Zoom functionality
- Your agent needs flexibility to handle various meeting-related requests
- You're building a general-purpose assistant
**Use specific actions when:**
- You want to limit agent capabilities for security or compliance
- Your use case only requires certain actions (e.g., scheduling but not deleting)
- You want to keep your agent focused on specific tasks

## Example use cases

### General meeting assistant

Enable **All Zoom Actions** for this use case.

**Prompt:**
```
You are a professional meeting coordinator that helps users manage their Zoom meetings.
You can:
- Schedule new Zoom meetings
- Update meeting details
- Cancel meetings
- Manage registrants
- Find meeting recordings
Always confirm meeting details with the user before creating or modifying.
```

### Scheduled meeting creator only

Enable only **Create Meeting** for this use case.

**Prompt:**
```
You help users schedule Zoom meetings.
When scheduling a meeting:
1. Ask for meeting topic
2. Confirm date and time
3. Ask about duration
4. Create the meeting and share the join link
You cannot modify or cancel meetings once created.
```

### Meeting insights agent

Enable **Get Meetings** and **Search Recordings** for this use case.

**Prompt:**

```
You provide insights about past Zoom meetings.
You can:
- List upcoming and past meetings
- Search for meeting recordings
- Provide meeting statistics
You cannot create, modify, or delete meetings.
```

## Security & privacy

### OAuth permissions

The Zoom integration requests the following permissions:
- Create and manage meetings
- Access meeting details
- Manage meeting registrants
- Access cloud recordings
These permissions are granted through Zoom's OAuth flow and can be revoked at any time by disconnecting the integration.

### Data handling

**What PolyAI stores:**
- Your Zoom account name and type (for display in the connection panel)
- Connection timestamp and environment settings
**What PolyAI does NOT store:**
- Zoom OAuth tokens or credentials (managed securely by Paragon)
- Meeting content or recordings
- Participant information

## Troubleshooting

### Integration not appearing

**Check:**
- Zoom integration feature is enabled for your account
- You have project management permissions
- You're viewing the correct environment (Sandbox/Pre-release/Live)

### Agent can't use Zoom functions

**Check:**
- Zoom is connected for the environment your agent is running in
- You've enabled Zoom actions in your agent's prompt (either **All Zoom Actions** or specific actions)
- The connection hasn't been disconnected or expired

### OAuth errors during connection

**Try:**
- Ensure pop-ups are not blocked in your browser
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser
- Check that you're logged into the correct Zoom account

### Functions not working as expected

**Verify:**
- Your Zoom account has the necessary permissions for the action
- Meeting IDs and parameters are correct
- The Zoom account is active and in good standing
