## Introduction

This document describes how PolyAI integrates with a client’s **Gladly Knowledge Base** using the Gladly API. The purpose of this integration is to securely connect PolyAI’s conversational agents with up-to-date, client-owned knowledge stored in Gladly, enabling agents to deliver accurate, consistent, and contextually relevant responses during customer interactions.

By integrating directly with the Gladly Knowledge Base, PolyAI clients can ensure their virtual agents reflect the same source of truth used by human agents, reducing maintenance overhead and eliminating knowledge duplication. This integration allows content updates made in Gladly to be automatically surfaced in PolyAI conversations, improving response accuracy, accelerating time to value, and delivering a more seamless customer experience across automated and human-assisted support channels.

## Obtaining Your Gladly Organisation URL and API Credentials

This guide explains how to obtain your **Gladly organisation URL** and generate an **API username and API token**. These credentials are required to authenticate API requests and integrate with your Gladly organisation.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the **Gladly Admin Console**
- An account with sufficient permissions to manage users and API access
- Access to the Gladly developer documentation: https://developer.gladly.com/rest/#section/Getting-Started/Permissions

## Step 1: Identify Your Gladly Organisation URL

Your **organisation URL** uniquely identifies your Gladly instance and is required for all API requests.

### How to find it

1. Log in to your Gladly instance via your browser
2. Look at the URL in the address bar

Your organisation URL follows this format:

```text
https://<your-organisation>.gladly.com
```

### Example

```text
https://acme.gladly.com
```

In this example:

- **Organisation URL:** `https://acme.gladly.com`
- **Organisation name:** `acme`

## Step 2: Create or Select a Gladly User for API Access

API authentication in Gladly is performed using a **username and API token** associated with a Gladly user.

You may:

- Use an existing service account, or
- Create a dedicated user specifically for API integrations (recommended)

### Create a new user (recommended)

1. Log in to the **Gladly Admin Console**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Users**
3. Click **Add User**
4. Create a user with a descriptive name (for example, `polyai-integration`)
5. Assign the appropriate role (see permissions below)
6. Save the user

## Step 3: Assign Required Permissions

The user used for API access must have the appropriate permissions to perform API operations.

1. In the **Gladly Admin Console**, open the user profile
2. Assign a role that includes the required API permissions, as documented here: https://developer.gladly.com/rest/#section/Getting-Started/Permissions

> ⚠️ **Note** The exact permissions required depend on your integration use case. Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Step 4: Generate an API Token (Password)

Gladly API authentication uses **Basic Authentication** with:

- **Username:** Gladly username
- **Password:** API token (not the user’s login password)

### Generate the API token

1. In the **Gladly Admin Console**, open the user profile
2. Locate the **API Token** or **API Access** section
3. Generate a new API token
4. Copy the token securely

> 🔐 **Important** The API token is shown only once. Store it securely, as it cannot be retrieved later.

## Next Steps

Once you have:

- Your **organisation URL**
- A **Gladly username**
- A valid **API token**

You can proceed with configuring your integration through PolyAI Agent Studio Integration Page in your project.
