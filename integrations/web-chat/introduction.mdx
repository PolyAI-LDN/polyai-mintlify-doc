<Tip>Visit the [API reference](/api-reference/chat) for more detailed information on Chat API response parameters and authentication.</Tip>

Use the Chat API to integrate PolyAI agents into existing <Tooltip tip="Non-voice chat systems, including live in-browser chats and widgets, as well as text and email conversations.">Webchat</Tooltip>
systems, and use its endpoints to get programmatic access to your automated chat interactions. This API structures non-voice web
integration conversations, messages, and chat sessions using a simple set of REST endpoints.

The Chat API powers multiple PolyAI Webchat integrations:

- [Email](email)
- [SMS](sms)
- [In-app chat](in-app-chat)
- [WhatsApp](whatsapp)

## Chatting with the API

1. **Initiate conversation**: Send a POST `/chat/create` request with required headers.
2. **Send and receive messages**: Use the `/chat/respond` endpoint for ongoing interaction.
3. **Validation**: Requests are validated for API key, token, and payload.
4. **Conversation termination**: Use the `end_conversation` flag in responses to identify when a session ends.

## Endpoints

### Base URLs

The Chat API is available in the following regions:

| Region      | URL                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| US          | https://api.us-1.platform.polyai.app |
| UK          | https://api.uk-1.platform.polyai.app |
| EUW         | https://api.euw-1.platform.polyai.app |

### API path format

All endpoints follow this structure:

```http
POST /v1/{account_id}/{project_id}/chat/{operation}
```

- `account_id`: Your PolyAI account ID, e.g., `ACCOUNT-12345678`.
- `project_id`: Your PolyAI project ID, e.g., `PROJECT-87654321`.

## User flow

### Pre-usage setup

1. **Request access**: Request Chat API enablement for their project.
2. **Provision credentials**: A PolyAI engineer generates an API key and connector token.
3. **Authorization setup**: The API key must include the required permissions:

```json
[
  {
    "Action": "PLATFORM:PROJECT-eb85e04a:POST:/v1/PLATFORM/PROJECT-eb85e04a/chat/create",
    "Effect": "ALLOW"
  },
  {
    "Action": "PLATFORM:PROJECT-eb85e04a:POST:/v1/PLATFORM/PROJECT-eb85e04a/chat/respond",
    "Effect": "ALLOW"

]
```
