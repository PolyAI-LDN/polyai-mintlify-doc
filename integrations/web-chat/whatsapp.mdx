description: Enable WhatsApp messaging for your PolyAI agent.

PolyAI enables seamless integration with **WhatsApp** via **Twilio**, allowing your agent to engage with customers over one of the world's
most widely used messaging platforms.

PolyAI provisions WhatsApp numbers through Twilio and manages the setup internally. This means there is **no need for you to configure
 connectors or webhooks manually**.

Once your PolyAI agent is enabled for WhatsApp, it will be able to send and receive messages, applying the same conversation logic
as other supported channels.

## Enabling WhatsApp messaging

To get started, contact **PolyAI Support** or your account manager. The PolyAI team will:
1. **Assign a WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number to your agent**
2. **Handle all backend configurations and integrations**
3. **Confirm when the setup is complete and ready for use**

Once enabled, your agent can:
- Send and receive messages on WhatsApp
- Maintain conversation history across multiple channels
- Apply automation, rules, and fallback behaviors just like in voice or web chat
