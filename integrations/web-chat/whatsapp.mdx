description: Enable WhatsApp messaging for your PolyAI agent.
---

You can connect PolyAI agents **WhatsApp** using **Twilio**, so your agents can engage with customers over one of the world's
most widely used messaging platforms. Once your PolyAI agent is enabled for WhatsApp, it will be able to send and receive messages, using the same conversation logic
as other Webchat channels.

<Note> PolyAI provisions WhatsApp numbers through Twilio and manages the setup internally. This means there is **no need for you to configure
 connectors or webhooks manually**. </Note>

## Enabling WhatsApp messaging

To get started, contact [PolyAI Support](mailto:platform-support@poly-ai.com) or your account manager. The PolyAI team will:
1. **Assign a WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number to your agent**
2. **Handle all backend configurations and integrations**
3. **Confirm when the setup is complete and ready for use**

Once enabled, your agent can:
- Send and receive messages on WhatsApp
- Apply automation, rules, and fallback behaviors just like in voice or web chat
