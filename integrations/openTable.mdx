PolyAI's OpenTable integration gives AI voice assistant capability to both [Core](https://www.opentable.com/restaurant-solutions/plans/core/)
and [Pro](https://www.opentable.com/restaurant-solutions/plans/pro/) OpenTable customers. Reservations
made through PolyAI are displayed as **Phone/In-house** in OpenTable reporting.
