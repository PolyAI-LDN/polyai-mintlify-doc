# Overview
A DNIs Pool is a rotating pool of DNIs (Dynamic Number Insertion) that you can dial to
connect to your Virtual Agent in the PolyAI infrastructure. The main benefit of using this
integration is the ability to share structured JSON data to your Agent at the start of the call.
This is great if you are using:
- PSTN (where sharing metadata is technically not possible at all).
- SIP installations where sending custom SIP Headers is not enabled or supported.
Other than sharing initial info, you will also want to retrieve some information at 
the end of the call: for example, whether the call was terminated successfully or 
if you need to transfer it to a human agent for additional help.
The main use case here is for you to be able to send **at least** a shared ID that you
can then use to retrieve that handoff information at the end of the call, but you can
send and retrieve much more structured data.

The following docs will help you setting up a DNIs Pooling Integration with PolyAI!

# How does it work
The integration relies on two main Endpoints that you will integrate with:
- [DNI Reservation](/api-reference/conversations/endpoint/dni-reservation)
- [Get Handoff](api-reference/conversations/endpoint/get-handoff)

It works as follows - we will refer as you integrating with PolyAI as Client:
1. Client posts the Attributes for your project  
2. PolyAI stores them
3. PolyAI returns a DNI (example: +12345)  
4. Client calls the DNI  
5. PolyAI retrieves the Attributes for the DNI  
6. PolyAI transmit the Attributes to your Agent based on your API Key
7. PolyAI automates the call, storing any info Client and PolyAI agreed on (example: handoff info) 
8. PolyAI ends the call  
9. PolyAI send SIP BYE  
10. Client gets the handoff state  
11. Client checks if the handoff state is non empty, transferring accordingly, otherwise it will end the call

# What you will need
You will need the following from your contact at PolyAI:
- An API token for the Reserve DNI Endpoint
- An API token for the Get handoff Endpoint
- Your account_id and project_id
