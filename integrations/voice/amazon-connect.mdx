Use the [Amazon Connect integration](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rwoh2vu3mruba?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) to connect PolyAI voice agents to your AWS ecosystem. Utilize [Amazon Connect contact flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-initiation-methods.html) for dynamic call routing and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) for real-time data processing.

## Capabilities

### Call handling and analytics
PolyAI voice agents manage inbound calls routed via [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/). Agents capture customer intent, execute knowledge-based responses, and reduce the load on live agents. Call performance, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency are tracked using Amazon Connect analytics, integrated with PolyAI's conversation data.

### Live agent handoff
Calls requiring human assistance are routed to Amazon Connect agents with full contextual data for continuity and personalized support.

### Secure data access
PolyAI securely retrieves and updates customer data using [AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

## How the integration works

![connect-diagram](/images/integrations/amazon/diagram.png)

1. Inbound call handling: Amazon Connect selects a number from a pool of PolyAI-provisioned phone numbers for incoming calls.
2. Routing to PolyAI: Calls are transferred to the PolyAI conversational assistant, which retrieves contact attributes from DynamoDB using an AWS IAM role with appropriate permissions.
3. Guided conversational flows: The PolyAI assistant greets the caller and executes customized conversational flows, such as identity verification or information collection.
4. Handoff or resolution: If the query is resolved, the call is terminated. Unresolved queries are routed back to Amazon Connect for queue-based agent handling.
5. Data management: Data from the interaction (e.g., transcripts, query status) is sent to Amazon Connect and stored in S3 buckets using the same AWS IAM role.

## Setup guide

### Prerequisites

- **Amazon Connect instance**: Ensure an active Amazon Connect instance with administrative access.
- **PolyAI project**: Set up a PolyAI assistant aligned with your Amazon Connect workflows.
- **AWS services**:
  - DynamoDB: For securely storing call attributes.
  - Lambda: For processing event data.
  - STS: For secure role-based data access.
- **Integration credentials**:
  - IAM role: Create an IAM role with policies for DynamoDB and Lambda access, allowing PolyAI to interact with AWS resources.

### 1: Configure Amazon Connect

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open Amazon Connect.
2. Use the Flow Designer to:
   - Create or edit a contact flow.
   - Add:
     - A PolyAI handoff node to route calls to the voice assistant.
     - A Lambda function node to retrieve and process call data.
3. Save and publish the contact flow.

### 2: Set up DynamoDB for call attributes

1. Create a DynamoDB table:
   - Define a primary key, such as CallID or CustomerID.
   - Add attributes like `customer_name` or `reservation_number`.
2. Link the table to the Lambda function for real-time updates.

### 3: Configure AWS Lambda function

1. Create a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console:
   - Use a provided or custom script to process call events.
2. Assign an IAM role with:
   - Permissions for DynamoDB and STS.
3. Deploy the function and link it to the Amazon Connect contact flow.

Example Lambda function template:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('YourDynamoDBTable')

    # Extract call attributes
    call_id = event['Details']['ContactData']['ContactId']
    caller_number = event['Details']['ContactData']['CustomerEndpoint']['Address']

    # Update or retrieve data
    response = table.update_item(
        Key={'CallID': call_id},
        UpdateExpression="SET caller_number =:val",
        ExpressionAttributeValues={':val': caller_number}
    )

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Call attributes updated successfully'
    }
```

### 4: Integrate PolyAI assistant

1. Provide PolyAI with:
   - Your [12-digit AWS Account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.html).
   - Your [Amazon Connect region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).
2. Set up the integration using [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html):
   - PolyAI will share an AWS CloudFormation template using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
   - Create a service role in your AWS account with the following policy, with `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>` replaced by your actual 12-digit AWS Account ID:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
               "cloudformation:*"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
           "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "s3:*",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amazon-connect-integration-sample-code/<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>/*"
       },
       {
           "Sid": "VisualEditor2",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "lambda:*",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:function:PolyAI*"
       },
       {
           "Sid": "VisualEditor3",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "iam:*",
           "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:iam::<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/PolyAI*",
               "arn:aws:iam::<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/PolyAI*"
           ]
       },
       {
           "Sid": "VisualEditor4",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "dynamodb:*",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:table/PolyAI*"
       }
   ]
}
```

3. Deploy the PolyAI CloudFormation stack, which will automatically create:
   - A DynamoDB table.
   - A Lambda function.
   - The required IAM roles.
4. Update your Amazon Connect flow to route calls to PolyAI voice agents.

### 5: Test and deploy

1. Test integration:
   - Verify everything works, like:
     - Try routing a call to various PolyAI assistants.
     - Make dummy data retrieval and status updates to test DynamoDB.
     - Simulate a live-agent handoff processes to make sure there are no problems.
2. Monitor analytics:
   - Use the Amazon Connect analytics dashboard to track call volume, routing efficiency, and agent handoffs.
