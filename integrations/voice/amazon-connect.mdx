Integrating PolyAI voice agents with Amazon Connect enhances your contact center by automating call handling, securely managing data, and
ensuring seamless live-agent handoffs. This guide walks you through setting up and optimizing the integration for efficient customer interactions.

## Overview of capabilities

### Automated call handling
PolyAI voice agents handle incoming calls routed via Amazon Connect, capturing customer intent and responding with knowledge-based answers. This
minimizes the load on live agents while maintaining high-quality service.

### Secure data access
PolyAI leverages **[AWS STS](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-credentials/)** (Security Token Service) to securely retrieve, update, and
store call attributes in **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)**. This ensures secure and real-time data exchange during the call lifecycle.

### Dynamic routing and workflows
PolyAI integrates with **[Amazon Connect Contact Flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-flows.html)** to support
advanced call routing based on customer input, predefined rules, or real-time conditions.

### Live-agent handoffs
Seamlessly transfer calls requiring human intervention to Amazon Connect agents with full contextual data, ensuring continuity and personalized
customer service.

### Real-time analytics
Track call performance, resolution rates, and agent interaction efficiency through Amazon Connect’s analytics dashboard, combined with PolyAI’s
detailed call logs.

## Prerequisites

1. **Amazon Connect instance**: Ensure you have an active Amazon Connect instance with administrative access.
2. **PolyAI project**: Configure your PolyAI project to align with Amazon Connect workflows.
3. **AWS services setup**:
   - **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)** for storing call attributes.
   - **[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)** for processing event data.
   - **[AWS STS](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-credentials/)** for secure data access.
4. **Integration credentials**: Obtain API keys and IAM roles for connecting Amazon Connect with PolyAI.

## Setting up the integration

### Configure Amazon Connect instance
1. Log in to your **AWS Management Console** and open **Amazon Connect**.
2. Navigate to the **Contact Flows** section and create or edit a flow.
3. Add the following key components to your flow:
   - **PolyAI handoff node**: Routes calls to PolyAI voice agents.
   - **Lambda function node**: Configures a Lambda function for processing call events.
4. Save and publish the flow.

Refer to **[Amazon Connect Contact Flows Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-flows.html)** for detailed steps.

### Configure AWS Lambda function
1. Create a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
2. Use the provided template for processing call events and securely retrieving attributes from DynamoDB.
3. Grant the Lambda function necessary permissions using an IAM role with DynamoDB and STS access.
4. Deploy and link the Lambda function to your Amazon Connect flow.

For more, see **[AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)**.

### Set up DynamoDB for call attributes
1. Create a DynamoDB table to store call attributes.
2. Define primary keys to manage data, such as `CallID` or `CustomerID`.
3. Link the DynamoDB table to your Lambda function for real-time data updates during call interactions.

Refer to **[Amazon DynamoDB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)** for additional
setup instructions.

### Integrate PolyAI APIs
1. Enable PolyAI APIs to:
   - Retrieve customer-specific data.
   - Update call attributes dynamically.
   - Log call outcomes in external systems.
2. Use AWS STS to securely authenticate PolyAI requests to AWS services during calls.

For API details, see **[PolyAI API Reference](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference)**.

## Testing and deployment

1. **Conduct end-to-end tests**: Verify that Amazon Connect, Lambda, DynamoDB, and PolyAI components function as expected.
2. **Monitor performance**: Use Amazon Connect’s analytics dashboard to track call volume, routing efficiency, and agent handoffs.
3. **Optimize workflows**: Adjust contact flows, API configurations, and Lambda function settings based on test results.
