Integrating PolyAI voice agents with Amazon Connect enhances your contact center by automating call handling, securely managing data, and ensuring seamless live-agent handoffs. This guide walks you through setting up and optimizing the integration for efficient customer interactions.

## Overview of capabilities

### Automated call handling
PolyAI voice agents handle incoming calls routed via **[Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/)**, capturing customer intent and responding with knowledge-based answers. This minimizes the load on live agents while maintaining high-quality service.

### Secure data access
PolyAI leverages **[AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html)** (Security Token Service) to securely retrieve, update, and store call attributes in **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)**. This ensures secure and real-time data exchange during the call lifecycle.

### Dynamic routing and workflows
PolyAI integrates with **[Amazon Connect Contact Flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-flows.html)** to support advanced call routing based on customer input, predefined rules, or real-time conditions.

### Live-agent handoffs
Seamlessly transfer calls requiring human intervention to Amazon Connect agents with full contextual data, ensuring continuity and personalized customer service.

### Real-time analytics
Track call performance, resolution rates, and agent interaction efficiency through Amazon Connect’s analytics dashboard, combined with PolyAI’s detailed call logs.

## Additional capabilities

### Scalability
Amazon Connect’s cloud-based CCaaS scalability, paired with PolyAI’s AI assistance, ensures calls are handled efficiently even during traffic surges. This guarantees operational continuity and exceptional customer experiences.

### Personalization
PolyAI retrieves customer profiles from CRMs and **Amazon Connect** before calls begin, enabling personalized and contextual interactions.

### Insights and business intelligence
With PolyAI’s APIs, businesses can access conversation data and request insights into customer satisfaction and service performance, empowering data-driven decision-making.

### Seamless feedback loop
Data collected by PolyAI informs **Amazon Connect’s Contact Flows**, ensuring calls are directed to the most appropriate flow for optimal outcomes.

## How the integration works

1. **Call initiation**: **Amazon Connect** routes inbound calls to a PolyAI-provisioned phone number.
2. **Assistant connection**: The call is transferred to the PolyAI conversational assistant, which retrieves contact attributes from **Amazon DynamoDB** via **AWS STS**.
3. **Caller interaction**: The conversational assistant greets the caller, verifies identity, collects information, and answers queries.
4. **Call resolution**: The assistant resolves the query or hands the call back to **Amazon Connect** for routing to a live agent.
5. **Data update**: Information collected by the assistant is pushed back to **Amazon Connect** for logging and analysis.

## Prerequisites

1. **Amazon Connect instance**: Ensure you have an active **Amazon Connect** instance with administrative access.
2. **PolyAI project**: Configure your PolyAI project to align with **Amazon Connect** workflows.
3. **AWS services setup**:
   - **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)** for storing call attributes.
   - **[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)** for processing event data.
   - **[AWS STS](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/manage-credentials/)** for secure data access.
4. **Integration credentials**: Obtain API keys and IAM roles for connecting **Amazon Connect** with PolyAI.

## Setting up the integration

### Configure Amazon Connect instance
1. Log in to your **AWS Management Console** and open **Amazon Connect**.
2. Navigate to the **Contact Flows** section and create or edit a flow.
3. Add the following key components to your flow:
   - **PolyAI handoff node**: Routes calls to PolyAI voice agents.
   - **Lambda function node**: Configures a **Lambda** function for processing call events.
4. Save and publish the flow.

### Configure AWS Lambda function
1. Create a **Lambda function** in the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Use the provided template for processing call events and securely retrieving attributes from **DynamoDB**.
3. Grant the **Lambda function** necessary permissions using an IAM role with **DynamoDB** and **STS** access.
4. Deploy and link the **Lambda function** to your **Amazon Connect** flow.

### Set up DynamoDB for call attributes
1. Create a **DynamoDB** table to store call attributes.
2. Define primary keys to manage data, such as `CallID` or `CustomerID`.
3. Link the **DynamoDB** table to your **Lambda function** for real-time data updates during call interactions.

### Additional onboarding requirements
1. Provide PolyAI with your **AWS account ID** and **Amazon Connect** region.
2. Create an IAM role named `polyai-cf-deployer` with the specified policy and trust relationship.
3. Work with the PolyAI team to deploy the CloudFormation stack, which will create a **DynamoDB** table, a **Lambda function**, and an **IAM role**.
4. Update your **Amazon Connect Contact Flow** to route calls to PolyAI bots.

## Testing and deployment

1. **Conduct end-to-end tests**: Verify that **Amazon Connect**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and PolyAI components function as expected.
2. **Monitor performance**: Use **Amazon Connect’s analytics dashboard** to track call volume, routing efficiency, and agent handoffs.
3. **Optimize workflows**: Adjust contact flows, API configurations, and **Lambda function** settings based on test results.
