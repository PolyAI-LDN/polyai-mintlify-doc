Integrating PolyAI voice agents with Five9 empowers your contact center to automate call handling, provide knowledge-based responses, and facilitate smooth live-agent handoffs. This guide details the setup and functionality of the integration to enhance customer interactions.

## Overview of capabilities

### Automated call handling
PolyAI voice agents manage incoming calls, capturing customer intent and delivering accurate, knowledge-based responses. This reduces the workload on live agents while ensuring effective customer service.

### Live-agent handoffs
Calls that require human intervention are seamlessly transferred to Five9 agents with contextual data, including customer details and interaction history. This ensures continuity and personalized support.

### Advanced routing
Five9's Intelligent Cloud Contact Center supports dynamic call routing. Integration with PolyAI ensures calls are routed based on predefined rules or real-time conditions.

### Reporting and analytics
Leverage Five9's analytics capabilities to monitor the performance of PolyAI voice agents, track call resolution rates, and optimize workflows based on actionable insights.
