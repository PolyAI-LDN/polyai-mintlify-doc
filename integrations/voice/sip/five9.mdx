Integrating PolyAI with Five9 enables advanced call handling, routing, and handoff to live agents when required. This guide explains setup procedures, routing methods, and best practices for transferring calls between PolyAI and Five9.

## 1: Integrate with the shared Five9 and PolyAI SIP trunk

Five9 uses a multi-tenant SIP trunk to connect with PolyAI. Contact your [Five9 account manager](https://www.five9.com/) to configure your environment to connect to this SIP trunk and route calls to PolyAI.

## 2: Five9 to PolyAI routing methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Authentication token">
    PolyAI provides an authentication token included in the SIP INVITE message under the X-header (`X-PolyAi-Auth-Token`). This token identifies and distinguishes traffic for accurate agent routing.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dialed extension">
    Five9 and PolyAI agree on unique extension numbers for routing calls. This method offers flexibility and scalability, especially for clients managing multiple PolyAI agents.

## 3: PolyAI to Five9 transfer methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SIP BYE with custom headers">
    When PolyAI is unable to contain a call, it sends a SIP BYE message with custom headers to indicate the status of the call. This method is simple and suitable for scenarios with limited metadata requirements.

    Key headers include:
    - `X-contained`: Indicates whether the call was contained by PolyAI. (`true` or `false`)
    - `X-destination`: Specifies where to transfer the call if it was not contained. Values are determined during deployment.

    <Warning> Five9 supports up to 10 custom headers. Additional requirements should be discussed with PolyAI during deployment. </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PolyAI Handoff API">
    For cases requiring detailed metadata, PolyAI provides a [Handoff API](https://docs.poly.ai/api-reference/#handoff-api) to return larger data payloads. This method involves:

    1. PolyAI sends a SIP BYE message to Five9 to indicate the agent call leg is complete.
    2. Five9 uses scripting to call the PolyAI Handoff API, using the Five9 session ID as the `shared_id` parameter to retrieve data.
    3. The API response includes:
       - `contained`: Indicates whether the call was contained. (`true` or `false`)
       - `destination`: Specifies the transfer destination if the call was not contained.

    **Benefits**:
    - No size limit on the API response, enabling detailed metadata transfer.
    - Flexible for advanced routing decisions.

    **Considerations**:
    - Ensure error handling in the Five9 scripting to manage API response issues.

    ### Example API integration

    ```python
    import requests

    def call_handoff_api(api_url, api_key, shared_id):
        """
        Calls the PolyAI Handoff API to retrieve call metadata.

        :param api_url: Handoff API URL
        :param api_key: PolyAI API key
        :param shared_id: Five9 session ID used for the call
        """
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        payload = {"shared_id": shared_id}

        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response_data = response.json()

        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response_data
        else:
            raise Exception(f"API Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

    # Example usage
    api_url = "https://api.poly.ai/handoff"
    api_key = "your_polyai_api_key"
    shared_id = "five9_session_id"

    data = call_handoff_api(api_url, api_key, shared_id)
    print("Call metadata:", data)
    ```
