Integrating PolyAI voice agents with Five9 provides a robust solution for automating customer interactions, streamlining workflows, and enabling seamless collaboration between AI and live agents. This guide outlines the integration process, features, and typical call flows, emphasizing customer benefits while minimizing technical complexity.

## Introduction

PolyAI's integration with Five9 is a validated, repeatable process that has been deployed successfully across multiple regions. It offers flexible configurations to meet diverse customer needs, ensuring simplicity in reporting and efficiency in call handling.

### Key Features of the Integration

1. **Automated call handling**: PolyAI voice agents handle FAQs, capture intent, and provide knowledge-based responses, reducing the workload on human agents.
2. **Dynamic routing**: Calls are routed intelligently using predefined business rules or real-time conditions in Five9's Intelligent Cloud Contact Center.
3. **Live-agent handoffs**: Calls requiring escalation are seamlessly transferred to Five9 agents, complete with contextual data like customer details and captured intents.
4. **Data exchange**: Both platforms can exchange information via SIP headers or APIs, enabling deeper integration and enhanced functionality, such as:
   - PolyAI checking current queue times in Five9.
   - PolyAI scheduling callbacks.
   - Five9 querying PolyAI for additional data on user interactions.

## SIP Trunk and Regional Availability

### Shared Trunk Setup

Five9 provides a shared SIP trunk for customers in the USA, simplifying the connection process. For other regions, similar setups can be deployed based on demand.

1. **Request Access**: Contact Five9 Professional Services (PS) to obtain a quote for using the shared trunk. This may involve one-time setup fees and ongoing port or license costs.
2. **Receive Numbers**: Once connected, Five9 provides phone numbers for routing calls to PolyAI.

### Global support

PolyAI operates multiple fully redundant, autonomous regions. Your PolyAI representative will guide you in choosing the best region for your deployment.

## Typical call flow

Here's how a standard call interaction between Five9 and PolyAI works:

1. **SIP INVITE**:
   - Five9 sends a SIP INVITE to PolyAI, including key metadata in X-headers (e.g., session IDs, account numbers).
   - Metadata is agreed upon during the design phase and can include up to 10 X-headers.

2. **Call handling by PolyAI**:
   - The virtual assistant engages with the caller, providing responses, capturing intent, or gathering information.

3. **Call outcomes**:
   - **Call Contained**: The user's query is resolved, and they disconnect.
   - **Call Transferred**: The call is handed off to a Five9 agent with relevant contextual data attached.

### X-Headers for Containment and Transfer

- **Contained calls**:
  - `X-contained: true`
  - Optional headers include user intent, captured FAQs, and account numbers.
- **Transferred calls**:
  - `X-contained: false`
  - Additional headers indicate transfer destinations or skill groups.

### Alternative solution: API integration

In cases where X-headers are not ideal, PolyAI's handoff API can be used to retrieve and send data dynamically. This method supports 
custom requirements and deeper integrations.

## Integration process

1. **SIP Trunk configuration**:
   - Five9 sets up the SIP trunk, and PolyAI configures endpoints.
   - Standard protocols include TLS/TCP and SRTP, with Digicert as the root provider.

2. **Testing and validation**:
   - Conduct basic connectivity tests (e.g., OPTIONS requests, initial calls).
   - Perform failover testing with all relevant Five9 data centers.
   - Validate headers and API calls through end-to-end testing.

3. **Go-Live**:
   - After validation, the integration goes live with support from both Five9 and PolyAI.

## Advanced capabilities

- **Custom SIP Headers**: Add project-specific metadata (e.g., order IDs, tracking numbers) to SIP messages.
- **API Integration**: Enable PolyAI and Five9 to query or exchange data dynamically during or after calls.

## Key benefits

1. **Scalability**: Handle peak call volumes effortlessly with cloud-native platforms.
2. **Flexibility**: Tailor the integration to meet specific business needs.
3. **Efficiency**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations.
4. **Insight**: Leverage analytics to monitor and optimize call flows.

## Notes

- Both platforms support regular updates, and precise steps may evolve over time.
