Integrate PolyAI voice agents with [Genesys Cloud](https://www.genesys.com/) to streamline customer interactions. This integration
enables automated call handling, knowledge-based responses, and transitions to live agents when required, while maintaining data synchronization
and call flow continuity.

## Overview of capabilities

### Automated call handling
PolyAI voice agents handle incoming calls, capturing customer intent and providing knowledge-based responses. The integration supports
multi-turn conversations and actions, reducing the workload on live agents.

### Live-agent handoffs
When a live agent is needed, PolyAI transitions the call to a Genesys Cloud agent with contextual data, including customer details and interaction
history, ensuring continuity and personalized service.

### Dynamic routing
[Architect workflows](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-architect/) enable flexible call routing to PolyAI voice agents based on
 predefined triggers, customer inputs, or dynamic business logic. This ensures calls are directed to the appropriate resource.

### API integrations
The integration uses [Web Services Data Actions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/web-services-data-actions-integration/) to fetch real-time
 data and execute business processes, such as updating CRM records or verifying account details.

### Call flow customization
Through [Genesys Architect](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-architect/), contact centers can design and deploy custom call flows that
incorporate PolyAI’s conversational AI capabilities into existing workflows.

## Prerequisites

1. Genesys Cloud account: Ensure access to a Genesys Cloud environment with admin privileges.
2. PolyAI project setup: Create and configure your PolyAI project to align with Genesys call flow requirements.
3. SIP trunk: [Configure a SIP trunk in Genesys Cloud](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-a-sip-trunk/) to enable communication between PolyAI and Genesys.
4. Web Services Data Actions: Set up a Genesys [Web Services Data Action](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/web-services-data-actions-integration/) to handle the real-time API calls necessary for a customer service setup.
5. Genesys Premium Wizard: PolyAI is a premium application in Genesys. Visit the [Premium Wizard Overview](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-premium-applications/) for more information on premium applications.

## Set up the integration

### Configure SIP trunk
1. Log in to the Genesys Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Telephony > Trunks** and create a new SIP trunk.
3. Enter the PolyAI SIP domain and authentication details as provided during project setup.
4. Save and validate the configuration by placing a test call.
5. For detailed steps, see [Create a SIP Trunk](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-a-sip-trunk/).

### Define call flows in Genesys Architect
1. Open [Genesys Architect](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-architect/) and create a new inbound call flow.
2. Configure routing logic to direct calls to PolyAI’s voice agents.
3. Use [Web Services Data Actions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/web-services-data-actions-integration/) for real-time data retrieval during the call flow.
4. Test the call flow to ensure it behaves as expected. For more, refer to [Create Architect Flows](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-inbound-call-flow/).

### Integrate PolyAI APIs

Once you are registered and active with Genesys, visit PolyAI's [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for information on capabilities.

1. Enable [Web Services Data Actions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/web-services-data-actions-integration/) in Genesys Cloud for API integrations.
2. Use PolyAI's API endpoints to:
   - Retrieve [handoff states](/api-reference/conversations/endpoints/get-handoff).
   - Fetch [customer-specific data](/api-reference/conversations/endpoints/get-conversation).

## Test and deploy

1. Run end-to-end tests: Verify that the SIP trunk, call flows, and API integrations function as expected.
2. Monitor performance: Use Genesys Cloud analytics [APIs](https://developer.genesys.cloud/analyticsdatamanagement/analytics/) and [dashboards](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/analytics-workspace-overview/) to track
call volume, routing efficiency, and agent interactions.
3. Optimize configurations: Adjust call flows and data actions based on test outcomes to improve performance.
