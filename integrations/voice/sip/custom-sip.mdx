title: 'Custom SIP'
---

**Custom SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)** integration in PolyAI allows you to leverage SIP headers for tailoring assistant behaviors based on call-specific metadata. By accessing SIP headers, builders can extract details like caller ID, dialed number, or other metadata transmitted through the SIP protocol.

## What is Custom SIP?

SIP headers provide a structured format for transmitting metadata during VoIP calls. This metadata can include details about the caller, the recipient, and other contextual information, enabling more personalized and context-aware interactions.

## Key attributes

The `conv` object provides access to SIP-related attributes that you can use in your assistant logic:

#### **sip_headers**
- **Description**: A dictionary containing SIP headers and their corresponding values.
- **Use case**: Extract caller-specific metadata or route calls dynamically.
- **Example**:

```python
caller_id = conv.sip_headers.get("From", "Unknown Caller")
print(f"Caller ID: {caller_id}")
```

#### **caller_number**
- **Description**: The phone number of the caller.
- **Use case**: Personalize responses based on the caller's number.
- **Example**:

```python
if conv.caller_number == "+15551234567":
    conv.goto_flow("vip_support_flow")
else:
    conv.goto_flow("general_support_flow")
```

#### **callee_number**
- **Description**: The phone number the caller dialed.
- **Use case**: Determine routing based on the number dialed.
- **Example**:

```python
dialed_number = conv.callee_number
if dialed_number == "+15557654321":
    conv.state.branch = "North Branch"
else:
    conv.state.branch = "South Branch"
```

### How to Use Custom SIP

1. **Access SIP headers**:
   - Use `conv.sip_headers` to retrieve metadata from the SIP protocol.
   - This is particularly useful for identifying caller attributes or custom routing.

2. **Dynamic routing**:
   - Utilize `caller_number` and `callee_number` to configure routing flows based on incoming and dialed numbers.

3. **Store data for contextual responses**:
   - Save SIP-related information into `conv.state` to persist data across the conversation.
   - Example:

```python
conv.state.metadata = {
    "caller_id": conv.sip_headers.get("From", "Unknown"),
    "dialed_number": conv.callee_number,
}
```

### Use cases

- **VIP routing**: Automatically direct high-priority callers to specific support flows.
- **Branch-specific handling**: Route calls to the appropriate branch or location based on the number dialed.
- **Dynamic personalization**: Use SIP headers to provide tailored greetings or responses.
