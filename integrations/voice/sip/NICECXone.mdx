The PolyAI and NICE CXone integration uses NICE's [Signal API](https://developer.niceincontact.com/API/AdminAPI#/Contacts/Signal%20a%20Contact) to manage handoff and voice interactions. This guide
provides steps for setup, configuration, and using the integration effectively.

## Overview

### Shared NICE integration
PolyAI uses a shared NICE [connector service](https://help.nice-incontact.com/content/studio/advanced/dbconnector/dbconnector.htm) integration, so uses common IPs across clients. Each
client has unique [pseudo numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) assigned by NICE, which are used alongside the connector's [authentication token](https://developer.niceincontact.com/API/AuthenticationAPI#/Token/getToken) to route calls to a project.

## Handoff process

### Signal API
PolyAI uses the Signal API for call handoffs. This API supports up to **9** additional parameters, making it useful for passing larger
data sets to clients.

#### Requirements for the Signal API
- A Client-provided `access_key_id` and access_key_secret.
- The `Client_id` and `client_secret` from NICE: To obtain these, fill out the [NICE API application form](https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=vdojcYcOqU2cubfsggEarfHlkRVlgSlMjqsp52ASGttUMEJaSkQ0Rk5LVkIwOFZNWUtCUkFTWUVHUS4u&route=shorturl). Include:
  - Your CxOne [business unit](https://help.nice-incontact.com/content/acd/businessunits/businessunit.htm) number.
  - Your contact details, arbitrary application name, and description.
  - Answer tenant-related questions: Select **Single** and **Global**.
  - For Questions 10 and 11: Choose `secret_basic` and `AdminAPI`.
  - For Question 12: Select **Back-End**.

Expect a few days for processing to complete, and then you will receive a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### Using the Signal API
1. Configure the Signal API in the PolyAI project:
   - Use `CxOneClient` to initialize as a service in `services > __init__.py`.
   - Call the `signal` function, requiring a `contact_id` passed via an X-Header in the initial SIP INVITE.
2. Pass additional data:
   - Use the API to include up to 9 arbitrary parameters if more detailed data is required than the SIP X-Header can accommodate.

## Setup steps

### 1: Obtain required credentials
- **From NICE**: Retrieve `client_id` and `client_secret` after form submission.
- **From the client**: `Access_key_id` and `access_key_secret`, and the CxOne business unit number.

### 2: Configure the NICE connector in PolyAI
1. Add a NICE connector to your PolyAI project.
2. Save the provided authentication token for routing calls.
3. If applicable, enable the Handoff API in your project and generate an API key for screen-pop or related functionality.
