## Introduction

PolyAI integrates with Zendesk CRM to enable conversational agents to access and act on customer support data in real time. By connecting PolyAI to Zendesk, clients can empower virtual agents to retrieve ticket information, update records, and deliver more personalised, efficient customer interactions—while maintaining secure, permission-based access to their Zendesk environment.

This integration uses Zendesk’s API token authentication and requires a Zendesk user with sufficient permissions to generate and manage API access.

## How to Integrate Zendesk with PolyAI

To complete the integration, you will generate a Zendesk API token, identify the required authentication details, and provide them to PolyAI to finalise the connection.

---

### Step 1: Log in to Your Zendesk Account

1. Log in to your **Zendesk Admin Center**
2. Ensure you have permissions to manage API access (Admin role required)

---

### Step 2: Enable API Token Access

If API token access is not already enabled:

1. In **Zendesk Admin Center**, navigate to:\
   **Apps and integrations → APIs → Zendesk API**
2. Enable **Token access**
3. Save your changes

For detailed instructions, refer to Zendesk documentation:\
https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Managing-API-token-access-to-the-Zendesk-API

---

### Step 3: Generate an API Token

1. While still in **Zendesk API settings**, click **Add API token**
2. Enter a descriptive name (for example, `polyai-integration`)
3. Click **Create**
4. Copy the generated API token securely

> 🔐 **Important**\
> The API token is displayed only once. Store it securely, as it cannot be retrieved later.

---

### Step 4: Obtain the Required Authentication Details

Zendesk API authentication using an API token requires the following three pieces of information:

#### 1. Organisation URL

Your Zendesk organisation URL follows this format:

```text
https://<your-subdomain>.zendesk.com
```

**Example:**

```text
https://acme.zendesk.com
```

#### 2. User Email Address

Use the email address of the Zendesk user who generated the API token.

**Example:**

```text
polyai-integration@acme.com
```

#### 3. API Token

The API token generated in Step 3.

Zendesk uses **Basic Authentication**, where:

- **Username:** `<email_address>/token`
- **Password:** `<api_token>`

### Step 5: Provide Credentials to PolyAI

Once you have collected all required information, provide the following details to PolyAI through integration page under your project:

- **Zendesk Organisation URL**
- **Zendesk User Email Address**
- **Zendesk API Token**

These credentials allow PolyAI to securely connect to your Zendesk instance and complete the integration.
