[Amadeus HotSOS](https://www.amadeus-hospitality.com/service-optimization-software/hotsos/) (**Hot**el **S**ervice **O**ptimization **S**olution) is a hospitality platform widely used for managing guest service requests, housekeeping, and maintenance workflows. It functions as a centralized task management system for hotels.

PolyAI's integration connects virtual agents to the HotSOS system, allowing guest requests and maintenance issues to be logged directly and in real-time. This
reduces manual data entry and ensures tasks are routed to the appropriate teams.

## Setup and activation

### Compatibility
- Your property must use **HotSOS**, which provides structured workflows for guest services and property management.
- You must have the necessary **API credentials** from Amadeus, including:
  - REST or SOAP endpoint URLs (e.g., `https://ifc.emea.hot-sos.net/api/service.svc/rest`).
  - API keys or other authentication tokens.

### Configure your integration

<Warning>The integration currently only supports service orders from the [standardized list](#standardized-service-orders). Check the [limitations](#limitations) for more information.</Warning>

1. **Review and select service orders:** Access the [service order list](https://help.amadeus-hospitality.com/operations/service-optimization/content/service-orders.html), which includes predefined tasks such as delivering towels or reporting maintenance issues. Customize the list to meet your property's needs.
2. **Set configurations:**
   - Define **item limits** (e.g., up to 4 towels per request).
   - Enable **multi-item handling**, allowing up to 3 items in a single request (e.g., “Towel, toothbrush, and shampoo”).
3. **Verify room number detection:** Confirm whether your phone system supports automatic room number detection for calls made from guest rooms. If not, enable manual entry using the phone keypad as a fallback.

### Deploy the integration
- Contact PolyAI to deploy and configure the integration. PolyAI will connect your HotSOS system to the virtual agent and assist with setup.
- Test the integration to ensure:
  - Requests are logged with the correct issue codes and quantities in HotSOS.
  - Room number detection or manual input works as expected.

For assistance with deployment or troubleshooting, contact your PolyAI account manager.

## Capabilities

### Direct service order logging
- Logs guest requests directly into HotSOS, eliminating manual input from staff.
- Each request is automatically assigned a predefined issue code for proper categorization and tracking.

### Automated task routing
- Categorizes requests (e.g., housekeeping, maintenance, or supplies) and routes them to the appropriate teams based on the assigned issue code.
- Reduces delays and communication overhead between staff.

### Multi-item handling
- Handles requests for up to **4 units** of a single item in one order.
- Supports up to **3 distinct items** in a single guest request (e.g., “Two towels, one toothbrush, and one shampoo”).
- Consolidates multi-item requests into a single workflow to streamline task allocation.

### Room number detection
- Automatically detects the guest's room number for calls made from in-room phones (if supported by SIP data).
- Provides a fallback option for guests to enter their room number manually using the phone keypad.

### HotSOS reporting integration
- Logs requests directly into HotSOS dashboards and reports.
- Enables properties to monitor task completion rates, analyze request trends, and assess team performance.

### Customizable workflows
- Tailor issue codes and service orders to match your property's needs.
- Adjust item limits, request restrictions, and workflows post-integration to align with operational changes.

## Limitations

- **No order updates:** Cancellations, amendments, or confirmations of orders are not supported.
- **Duplicate orders:** Duplicate requests cannot be created for unresolved issues already logged in HotSOS.
- **Unsupported requests:** Tasks outside the enabled service order list are redirected to the property app or transferred to staff.
- **Language availability:** Only **English** is currently supported.

## Standardized service orders

HotSOS includes a predefined list of service orders compatible with the PolyAI integration. Customize this list to fit your property's needs.
